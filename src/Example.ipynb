       "  'cuerpo': '(CNN) In August 2019when a Facebook employee typed \"climate change\" into the platform s search barthe auto fill suggestions that popped up included \"climate change debunked\" and \"climate change is a hoax \" The results prompted the employee to ask in a post on the company s internal site\"Do our policies combatting the spread of misinformation on Facebook apply to climate denialism \"More than a year laterin January 2021a Facebook employee noted a similar concern when searching for \"climate change\" on the social network s video on demand serviceFacebook WatchThe second resultaccording to the employeewas a video titled \"Climate Change Panic is not based on facts \" The video had been posted nine days earlier and already had 6 6 million viewsaccording to another internal post These examples were flagged by Facebook employees on the company s internal siteaccording to documents reviewed by CNN BusinessThese were part of the hundreds of internal company documents included as evidence to support disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen s legal counselA consortium of news organizationsincluding CNNreviewed the redacted versions received by Congress The documents highlight howfor yearssome employees of the social media company which recently changed its name to Meta have raised alarms about climate change misinformation spreading on its platformsand called on the company to do more to crack down on it There has long been public pressure on the social media company to take action on climate change misinformationIn MarchCEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted to lawmakers that \"climate misinformation is a big issue \"This weekMeta announced additional climate related efforts that coincided with the start of the COP26 Climate Summitwhere world leaders gathered to discuss efforts to prevent catastrophic disruptions due to climate changeMeta was already facing heavy scrutiny following the leak of tens of thousands of pages of internal documents Haugen took from the companynow known as the \"Facebook Papers \"Although Facebook has taken a number of steps in recent years to address climate change misinformationit has so far resisted calls to remove such content altogetherthe way it does for Covid 19 or election misinformationInsteadit has focused on efforts to promote good information and relies on third party fact checkers to label false claims On Mondaythe company s VP of Global AffairsNick Cleggannounced in a blog post additional steps Facebook is taking to address climate changeincluding expanding informational labels on some posts about climate change to more than a dozen countries But the company s own research has hinted at limitations with some of its strategyincluding highlighting user trust and awareness issues with its Climate Science Centera dedicated hub for climate change information that launched last yearthe documents showSome employees have also expressed concern that Facebook s current efforts aren t sufficientdocuments showIn a comment on another internal post from earlier this year about the company s efforts to combat climate change including by enabling people to raise funds to fight climate change on Instagram and Facebook one employee said\"This is great workCan we take it a step farther and start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from our platforms \"Meta has repeatedly said the \"Facebook Papers\" paint a skewed picture of the company and its effortsThe company said the internal documents underscore \"the reasons why we ve launched our Climate Science Center and has informed our approach to connecting people with authoritative information about climate change from the world s leading climate change organizations \"\"As a resultmore than 100 000 people are visiting the Climate Science Center every day and we re continuing to update it with new features and more actionable resources so people know how they can make a difference \" Meta spokesperson Kevin McAlister said in a statement to CNN BusinessHe added that on Facebook Search and Watchthe company has removed climate denial suggestions and now directs users to the Climate Science Center and other authoritative information sourcesand that misinformation makes up only a small percentage of all climate related content on the company s platforms Expertshoweversay the stakes could not be higher for Facebook to further ramp up its solutions for this problem and soon \"Given thatclimate changeis an existential threatwe can t be casual about the seriousness about the threat of climate misinformation \" said John Cooka research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University\"It needs to be addressed with the same level of urgency and proactiveness that they re showing with Covid 19 and election misinformation \"The shortcomings of Facebook s climate misinformation strategyFacebook launched its Climate Science Center last fall in an effort to provide users with authoritativereliable information about climate change and climate scienceIn Septemberit said the resource had expanded to 16 countries and was reaching more than 100 000 daily visitors(Facebook had 1 93 billion daily active users as of that same month ) On Mondaythe company said the Climate Science Center will soon be available in more than 100 countries But the company s internal documents suggest there may be barriers to effectively countering misinformation with the Climate Science Center \"Facebook is a key place for people to get information related to climate changeso there is an opportunity to build knowledge through our platform \" according to one internal report posted in AprilHoweverthe researchers found user awareness of the Climate Science Center was lowThe report said 66of users surveyed who had visited the center \"say they are not aware\" of it86of those who hadn t visited it said they didn t know about it The report also found that some users did not trust the information Facebook published in its Climate Science Centerespecially US usersThis tracks with research on the effects of climate misinformationaccording to Cook \"Providing facts is necessary but it s insufficient to deal with misinformation \" Cook saidadding that his and othersresearch has found that \"misinformation can cancel out facts \" For exampleif a Facebook post says one thing and a fact check label says anotherit can leave a user confused and believing neitherAn effective strategy to address climate misinformation \"needs to be a mix of providing facts and countering misinformation with fact checkingbut also there need to be efforts to reduce the spread of misinformation or to bring down misinformation \" Cook said Metahoweversays that research was meant to inform internal discussions but was not representative of its user base and therefore not to measure casual relationships between its users and real world issuesIt also notes that some outside research has found thatin generalpeople in the United States are less likely to believe in climate change than people from other countriesA Pew Research survey from last yearfor examplefound that the United States ranked among the bottom in a list of 14 developed countries in terms of its citizens believing global climate change is \"a major threat\" to their country Facebook says it does \"downrank \" or reduce the spreadof climate change content that third party fact checkers have labeled as falseand says \"we take action\" against pagesgroups or accounts that regularly share false claims about climate science \"We work with a global network of over 80 independent fact checking organizations who review and rate contentincluding climate contentin more than 60 languages \" the company said in blog post Monday\"When they rate content as falsewe add a warning label and move it lower in News Feed so fewer people see itWe don t allow ads that have been rated by one of our fact checking partners \"But it doesn t outright remove climate change misinformation something it does do for misinformation about Covid 19vaccines and elections Zuckerberg explained that policy to lawmakers in a March hearing\"We divide the misinformation into things that could cause imminent physical harmof which Covid misinformation that might lead someone to get sick falls in the category of imminent physical harmand we take down that contentAnd then other misinformation are things that are false but may not lead to imminent physical harmwe label and reduce their distribution but leave them up \" he said7Howeverenvironmental advocates say climate change does indeed present imminent threats to safety \"People around the US have faced harm from extreme events just in the last few months with Hurricane Ida and people dyingwildfires across the West and extreme heat in the Northwest \" said Kathy Mulveyaccountability campaign director for the Climate Energy team at the Union of Concerned Scientists\"Climate change is not a threat in the futureit s a reality in the present \"This story was first published on CNN comThe next front in Facebook s misinformation battleclimate change '},\n",

its name to Meta have raised alarms about climate change misinformation spreading on its platformsand called on the company to do more to crack down on it There has long been public pressure on the social media company to take action on climate change misinformationIn MarchCEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted to lawmakers thatclimate misinformation is a big issue This weekMeta announced additional climate related efforts that coincided with the start of the COP26 Climate Summitwhere world leaders gathered to discuss efforts to prevent catastrophic disruptions due to climate changeMeta was already facing heavy scrutiny following the leak of tens of thousands of pages of internal documents Haugen took from the companynow known as theFacebook Papers Although Facebook has taken a number of steps in recent years to address climate change misinformationit has so far resisted calls to remove such content altogetherthe way it does for Covid 19 or election misinformationInsteadit has focused on efforts to promote good information and relies on third party fact checkers to label false claims On Mondaythe company s VP of Global AffairsNick Cleggannounced in a blog post additional steps Facebook is taking to address climate changeincluding expanding informational labels on some posts about climate change to more than a dozen countries But the company s own research has hinted at limitations with some of its strategyincluding highlighting user trust and awareness issues with its Climate Science Centera dedicated hub for climate change information that launched last yearthe documents showSome employees have also expressed concern that Facebook s current efforts aren t sufficientdocuments showIn a comment on another internal post from earlier this year about the company s efforts to combat climate change including by enabling people to raise funds to fight climate change on Instagram and Facebook one employee said This is great workCan we take it a step farther and start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from our platforms Meta has repeatedly said theFacebook Paperspaint a skewed picture of the company and its effortsThe company said the internal documents underscorethe reasons why we ve launched our Climate Science Center and has informed our approach to connecting people with authoritative information about climate change from the world s leading climate change organizationsAs a resultmore than 100 000 people are visiting the Climate Science Center every day and we re continuing to update it with new features and more actionable resources so people know how they can make a differenceMeta spokesperson Kevin McAlister said in a statement to CNN BusinessHe added that on Facebook Search and Watchthe company has removed climate denial suggestions and now directs users to the Climate Science Center and other authoritative information sourcesand that misinformation makes up only a small percentage of all climate related content on the company s platforms Expertshoweversay the stakes could not be higher for Facebook to further ramp up its solutions for this problem and soonGiven thatclimate changeis an existential threatwe can t be casual about the seriousness about the threat of climate misinformationsaid John Cooka post doctoral research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University It needs to be addressed with the same level of urgency and proactiveness that they re showing with Covid 19 and election misinformation The shortcomings of Facebook s climate misinformation strategyFacebook launched its Climate Science Center last fall in an effort to provide users with authoritativereliable information about climate change and climate scienceIn Septemberit said the resource had expanded to 16 countries and was reaching more than 100 000 daily visitors(Facebook had 1 93 billion daily active users as of that same month ) On Mondaythe company said the Climate Science Center will soon be available in more than 100 countries But the company s internal documents suggest there may be barriers to effectively countering misinformation with the Climate Science CenterFacebook is a key place for people to get information related to climate changeso there is an opportunity to build knowledge through our platformaccording to one internal report posted in AprilHoweverthe researchers found user awareness of the Climate Science Center was lowThe report said 66of users surveyed who had visited the centersay they are not awareof it86of those who hadn t visited it said they didn t know about it The report also found that some users did not trust the information Facebook published in its Climate Science Centerespecially US usersThis tracks with research on the effects of climate misinformationaccording to CookProviding facts is necessary but it s insufficient to deal with misinformationCook saidadding that his and othersresearch has found thatmisinformation can cancel out factsFor exampleif a Facebook post says one thing and a fact check label says anotherit can leave a user confused and believing neitherAn effective strategy to address climate misinformationneeds to be a mix of providing facts and countering misinformation with fact checkingbut also there need to be efforts to reduce the spread of misinformation or to bring down misinformationCook said Metahoweversays that research was meant to inform internal discussions but was not representative of its user base and therefore not to measure casual relationships between its users and real world issuesIt also notes that some outside research has found thatin generalpeople in the United States are less likely to believe in climate change than people from other countriesA Pew Research survey from last yearfor examplefound that the United States ranked among the bottom in a list of 14 developed countries in terms of its citizens believing global climate

Zuckerberg explained that policy to lawmakers in a March hearing We divide the misinformation into things that could cause imminent physical harmof which Covid misinformation that might lead someone to get sick falls in the category of imminent physical harmand we take down that contentAnd then other misinformation are things that are false but may not lead to imminent physical harmwe label and

changed its name to Meta have raised alarms about climate change misinformation spreading on its platformsand called on the company to do more to crack down on it There has long been public pressure on the social media company to take action on climate change misinformationIn MarchCEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted to lawmakers thatclimate misinformation is a big issue This weekMeta announced additional climate related efforts that coincided with the start of the COP26 Climate Summitwhere world leaders gathered to discuss efforts to prevent catastrophic disruptions due to climate changeMeta was already facing heavy scrutiny following the leak of tens of thousands of pages of internal documents Haugen took from the companynow known as theFacebook Papers Although Facebook has taken a number of steps in recent years to address climate change misinformationit has so far resisted calls to remove such content altogetherthe way it does for Covid 19 or election misinformationInsteadit has focused on efforts to promote good information and relies on third party fact checkers to label false claims On Mondaythe company s VP of Global AffairsNick Cleggannounced in a blog post additional steps Facebook is taking to address climate changeincluding expanding informational labels on some posts about climate change to more than a dozen countries But the company s own research has hinted at limitations with some of its strategyincluding highlighting user trust and awareness issues with its Climate Science Centera dedicated hub for climate change information that launched last yearthe documents showSome employees have also expressed concern that Facebook s current efforts aren t sufficientdocuments showIn a comment on another internal post from earlier this year about the company s efforts to combat climate change including by enabling people to raise funds to fight climate change on Instagram and Facebook one employee said This is great workCan we take it a step farther and start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from our platforms Meta has repeatedly said theFacebook Paperspaint a skewed picture of the company and its effortsThe company said the internal documents underscorethe reasons why we ve launched our Climate Science Center and has informed our approach to connecting people with authoritative information about climate change from the world s leading climate change organizationsAs a resultmore than 100 000 people are visiting the Climate Science Center every day and we re continuing to update it with new features and more actionable resources so people know how they can make a differenceMeta spokesperson Kevin McAlister said in a statement to CNN BusinessHe added that on Facebook Search and Watchthe company has removed climate denial suggestions and now directs users to the Climate Science Center and other authoritative information sourcesand that misinformation makes up only a small percentage of all climate related content on the company s platforms Expertshoweversay the stakes could not be higher for Facebook to further ramp up its solutions for this problem and soonGiven thatclimate changeis an existential threatwe can t be casual about the seriousness about the threat of climate misinformationsaid John Cooka post doctoral research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University It needs to be addressed with the same level of urgency and proactiveness that they re showing with Covid 19 and election misinformation Facebook launched its Climate Science Center in September 2020 in an effort to provide users with authoritative information about climate changeFacebookThe shortcomings of Facebook s climate misinformation strategyFacebook launched its Climate Science Center last fall in an effort to provide users with authoritativereliable information about climate change and climate scienceIn Septemberit said the resource had expanded to 16 countries and was reaching more than 100 000 daily visitors(Facebook had 1 93 billion daily active users as of that same month ) On Mondaythe company said the Climate Science Center will soon be available in more than 100 countries But the company s internal documents suggest there may be barriers to effectively countering misinformation with the Climate Science CenterFacebook is a key place for people to get information related to climate changeso there is an opportunity to build knowledge through our platformaccording to one internal report posted in AprilHoweverthe researchers found user awareness of the Climate Science Center was lowThe report said 66of users surveyed who had visited the centersay they are not awareof it86of those who hadn t visited it said they didn t know about it The report also found that some users did not trust the information Facebook published in its Climate Science Centerespecially US usersThis tracks with research on the effects of climate misinformationaccording to CookProviding facts is necessary but it s insufficient to deal with misinformationCook saidadding that his and othersresearch has found thatmisinformation can cancel out factsFor exampleif a Facebook post says one thing and a fact check label says anotherit can leave a user confused and believing neitherAn effective strategy to address climate misinformationneeds to be a mix of providing facts and countering misinformation with fact checkingbut also there need to be efforts to reduce the spread of misinformation or to bring down misinformationCook said Metahoweversays that research was meant to inform internal discussions but was not representative of its user base and therefore not to measure casual relationships between its users and real world issuesIt also notes that some outside research has found thatin generalpeople in the United States are less likely to believe in climate change than people from other countriesA Pew Research survey from last yearfor examplefound that the United States ranked among the bottom in a list of 14 developed countries in terms of its citizens believing global climate change isa major threatto their country Facebook says it doesdownrankor reduce the spreadof climate change content that third party fact checkers have labeled as falseand sayswe take actionagainst pagesgroups or accounts that regularly share false claims about climate scienceWe work with a global network of over 80 independent fact checking organizations who review and rate contentincluding climate contentin more than 60 languagesthe company said in blog post Monday When they rate content as falsewe add a warning label and move it lower in News Feed so fewer people see itWe don t allow ads that have been rated by one of our fact checking partners But it doesn t outright remove climate change misinformation something it does do for misinformation about Covid 19vaccines and elections Zuckerberg explained that policy to lawmakers in a March hearing We divide the misinformation into things that could cause imminent physical harmof which Covid misinformation that might lead someone to get sick falls in the category of imminent physical harmand we take down that contentAnd then other misinformation are things that are false but may not lead to imminent physical harmwe label and reduce their distribution but leave them uphe said Howeverenvironmental advocates say climate change does indeed present imminent threats to safetyPeople around the US have faced harm from extreme events just in the last few months with Hurricane Ida and people dyingwildfires across the West and extreme heat in the Northwestsaid Kathy Mulveyaccountability campaign director for the Climate Energy team at the Union of Concerned Scientists Climate change is not a threat in the futureit s a reality in the present '},\n",

internal research uncovered a host of problems on the platform related to public health and other issuesbut did virtually nothing about it The files were leaked by a whistleblowerformer Facebook employee Frances Haugenwho shared tens of thousands of documents with the Securities and Exchange CommissionCongressand a consortium of news organizationsShe has since testified before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and European lawmakers Amplifying \"Anti Vaxxers\" and Other MisinformationPresident Joe Biden caused a stir in July when he said that thanks to rampant misinformation about the COVID 19 vaccinesocial media platforms like Facebook are \"killing people I mean they re reallylookthe only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated \" he said\"And they re killing people \"While he was forced to walk back the statementthe leaked papers suggest he wasn t necessarily wrong According to the papersin March a time when the White House was preparing a1 5 billion campaign against vaccine misinformation some Facebook employees thought they had figured out a way to counter those lies on the platformand at the same time prioritize legitimate sources like the World Health Organization \"Given these resultsI m assuming we re hoping to launch ASAP \" an employee wrote But Facebook ignored some of the suggestions and executives dragged their heels implementing othersAnother proposalaimed at curtailing anti vaccine commentswas also ignored \"Why would you not remove commentsBecause engagement is the only thing that matters \" Imran AhmedCEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hatean internet watchdog grouptold The Associated Press\"It drives attention and attention equals eyeballs and eyeballs equal ad revenue \"Facebook s algorithms which determine the content you see in your feed also help to spread misinformation \"It s not like the anti vax contingent was created by Facebook \" says Dean SchillingerMDdirector of the Health Communications Research Program at the University of California San Francisco\"The algorithm said OKlet s find certain people with certain political beliefs and let s link them to anti vaxxers \" amplifying the misinformation\"That is certainly something that s novel \"If that weren t enoughit appears Facebook may have misled Congress about the company s understanding of how COVID misinformation spread on the platformIn Julytwo top House Democrats wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting details about how many users had seen COVID misinformation and how much money the company made from those posts \"At this timewe have nothing to share in response to the questions you have raisedoutside of what Mark has said publicly \" the company said in response But the leaked papers show that by that pointFacebook s researchers had run multiple studies on COVID misinformation and produced large internal reportsEmployees were able to calculate the number of views garnered by a widely shared piece of misinformationBut the company didn t acknowledge that to Congress Keeping this knowledge secret was a huge missed opportunity to ensure science backed information reached the general publicsays Sherry PagotoPhDdirector of the UConn Center for mHealth and Social Media \"We know how misinformation spreadsso how can we think more about disseminating good information \" she says\"They have all kinds of data on the characteristics of messages that go farHow can we use what they know in the field of health communication to come up with a plan \"In an emailed statementa spokesperson for Meta (in the midst of the uproarFacebook announced a new corporate name) said\"There s no silver bullet to fighting misinformationwhich is why we take a comprehensive approachwhich includes removing more than 20 million pieces of content that break our COVID misinformation policiespermanently banning thousands of repeat offenders from our servicesconnecting more than 2 billion people to reliable information about COVID 19 and vaccinesand partnering with independent fact checkers \"Ignoring Instagram s Effect on Vulnerable TeensMental HealthCombating misinformation isn t the only way Facebook and its subsidiaries could have acted to protect public healthThe company was also aware of its negative impact on young people s mental healthbut publicly denied it Instagramwhich is owned by Facebookis extremely popular among teenage girlsBut the photo sharing app exposes them repeatedly to images of idealized bodies and faceswhich can lead to negative self comparisons and pressure to look perfect Pro eating disorder content is also widely available on the platformFor yearssocial science and mental health researchers have been looking at social media s effect on mental healthparticularly for adolescentsStudies have found links between Instagram use and depressionanxietylow self esteemand eating disorders The Facebook papers revealed what Instagram researchers called a \"teen mental health deep dive \" And there were serious problemsThe internal research showed that the platform made body image issues worse for 1 in 3 teenage girlsand 14of teenage boys said Instagram made them feel worse about themselvesThe data linked use of the app with anxiety and depressionAnd among teens who reported thoughts of suicide6of American users and 13of British ones tied that impulse directly to Instagram Jean TwengePhDauthor of iGenWhy Today s Super Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less RebelliousMore TolerantLess Happy and Completely Unprepared for Adulthoodhas been studying social media s effects on young people for almost a decade \"I was not surprised that Facebook was finding social media could have significant links to depression and self harmThe academic research has been showing that for years \" she says\"I was surprised how in depth their research was into exactly the mindset of teen girls using InstagramTheir research really built on what we already knew \"As with Facebook s findings on misinformationthe company publicly downplayed Instagram s negative effects including in comments to Congress and did little to adjust teen usersexperience on the app \"I think that given what they knew about Instagram and mental healthit certainly would ve been the right thing to do to make changes to the platform \" Twenge says In their emailthe Meta spokesperson said\"Our research doesn t conclude that Instagram is inherently bad for teensWhile some teens told us Instagram made them feel worse when they were struggling with issues like lonelinessanxietyand sadnessmore teens told us that Instagram made them feel better when experiencing these same issues \"A Responsibility to the Public Good While Facebook users may be surprised to learn how the company regularly put profits ahead of its customershealththose who study public health are anything but \"This is not a problem in any way unique to social media platforms \" Schillinger says \"Corporate entities frequently pursue policies that engage the public to participate in activitiesto purchase or consume productsto implement behaviors that are unhealthy to themselves or others or the planetDo you think Facebook is acting differently than any other company in that space \"Which is where the potential for regulation comes inHaugenthe whistleblowersaidShe has called for itas have many lawmakers in the wake of her revelations \"Large organizations that have influence and access to lots of people need to be accountable to the well being of that populationjust as a matter of principle \" says sociologist Damon CentolaPhDauthor of ChangeHow to Make Big Things Happen He likens the explosion of social media to the history of televisionwhich has been regulated in numerous ways for decades \"I think that provides us with a parallel of social media and the capacity of the medium to influence the population \" he says\"It seems to me that organizations can t get away with saying they won t take public welfare into account \"The so called Facebook Papers are most damningsome experts saybecause the company s defense claims their research was only intended for product developmentso it doesn t prove anything This disregards all the peer reviewed paperspublished in respected journalsthat reinforce the findings of their internal researchTaken togetherthe two kinds of research leave little room for doubtand little doubt that something needs to change \"Think of it like environmental polluting \" Centola says\"Companies can know they re pollutingbut they can also say it didn t actually matterit didn t cause any harmBut then you get the documentation saying nothat has huge effectsThat s when it really does matter \"Social Media as a Force for GoodBut there is one potential upside of the Facebook papersaccording to the expertsIt s clear that the company knows a lot about how to spread messages effectivelyWith enough pressureFacebook and other social media platforms may now begin to use these insights in a positive direction \"Facebook should be developing a strong collaboration with trustworthy entities to develop content that s both true and promotes public healthwhile also engaging and algorithmically driven \" Schillinger says\"If we can use the platform and the reach and theartificial intelligenceFacebook has for health promoting contentthe sky s the limit \"And efforts like that may be on the horizon \"We re focused on building new features to help people struggling with negative social comparison or negative body image \" the Meta spokesperson wrote in the email\"We re also continuing to look for opportunities to work with more partners to publish independent studies in this areaand we re working through how we can allow external researchers more access to our data in a way that respects people s privacy \"Which is not to say that Facebook will voluntarily put public health before the company s need to make moneywithout regulations forcing them to do so \"I do think Facebook is interested in making their platform better for usersBut their first interest is always going to be having as many users as possible spending as much time as possible on the platform \" Twenge says\"Those two desires are often at cross purposes \"SourcesWall Street Journal\"The Facebook

       "  'cuerpo': 'Wiping down door handleCredit Getty ImagesRosalyn (not her real name) had no idea what she intended to do with the three boxes of spaghetti she had just dumped into her shopping cartShe didn t want them she certainly didn t need them but never mindshe had to buy themAnd the spaghetti boxes weren t the only unwanted items she picked up in the grocery store that day during the first year of the COVID 19 pandemicIf she so much as grazed one item while she was reaching for anotherinto the shopping cart it wentEverything my hand touched I had to buyshe said I didn t feel I had a choiceThere was too great a chance that I had somehow contaminated the itemand then it would hurt another unsuspecting customer who bought itSo she left the store with a bulging load of shopping bags and a lot of guilttoo Once I had bought so muchI worried there wouldn t be enough food left for other people Rosalyn is one of the 2 3of American adults diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorderor OCDaccording to the National Institute of Mental HealthOCD is caused principally by excessive activity in the amygdalaa walnut sized structure at the base of the brain that processes feardanger and the fight or flight responseThe disorder can manifest as compulsiverepetitive behaviorsan anxiety about getting ill or spreading germsor an excessive sense of responsibilityand an intense fear of causing risk to othersas in Rosalyn s caseEven people without an official diagnosis are affectedabout 25of Americans will exhibit at least some obsessive compulsive behavior at some point in their livesaccording to a 2008 study published in the journal Nature The pandemic has made life much worse for people with OCD symptomsNew research shows that OCD symptoms have gotten more severe for many people during the pandemicand new diagnoses have increasedMore and more people are turning up in doctorsoffices with new cases of the condition Studies have consistently shown that people without OCD have scored higher on our OCD assessments than they did before the pandemicsays Andrew Guzicka clinical psychologist at the Baylor College of Medicine They are exhibiting more OCD like behaviors and reporting more intrusive fears characteristic of OCD It s no wonderA global pandemic is a perfect breeding ground for anxietyOCD is a disorder of doubtWas that door knob contaminatedDid I leave the stove onDid I hear the doctor correctly when she told me that that freckle on my arm is really just a freckleRefract this kind of pre existing uncertainty through the lens of a pandemic that to date has infected more than 327 million people worldwidekilled 5 5 million and can strike anyoneand people who are already clinically anxious are going to experience even more anxietyOCD thrives on intolerance of uncertainty and a perceived need to prevent harmespecially as it relates to contaminationso it is no surprise that it has been a difficult time for people struggling with the disordersays GuzickHis meta analysispublished in October 2021 in Current Psychology Reportsfound that 32of people with OCD experienced a worsening of symptoms during the pandemic More from TIMEOCD is a contextual conditiongrowing worse in times of personal or environmental stress and easing back when circumstances grow calmerSince COVID 19 first emergeda flurry of research in addition to Guzick s has been conducted looking at the exacerbation of symptoms in people with the conditionand the findings have been troublingA September 2020 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Healthfor examplesurveyed more than 6 000 people with OCD and found that 60reported a worsening of existing OCD symptoms or an onset of new ones from the earliest days of the pandemic in late 2019 through the end of March 2020A November 2021 meta analysis of 21 studies published in Neuroscience Behavioral Reviews found that up to 65of respondents reported a worsening of their OCD during the pandemicYet another 2020 studypublished in BMC Psychiatry in Octoberfocused on young people ages 7 21 and found that nearly 45experienced a worsening of overall OCD symptoms within the first pandemic year Read More5 Ways to Feel Happier During the PandemicAccording to ScienceFor people suffering with OCD involving contaminationthe pandemic has been something of a validation atold you soto all of the people who had scolded them that their compulsive need to wash their hands and socially distance before the pandemic was excessive and unhealthy Welcome to my worldmemes have popped up all over the internet from OCD sufferers as the population at large began to adopt exactly the same precautionary habits they had long practicedBut that kind of satisfaction is short lived and comes with a long term priceThere are some folks who are saying I m actually having an amelioration of symptomsor I feel validated in my concernssays Michael Wheatonassistant professor of psychology at Barnard Collegeand the lead author of a June 2021 study in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders showing that 72of people with OCD had worse symptoms since the onset of the pandemic The problem ispeople without OCD respond to pandemic era guidelines very differently than people with the disorderWashing your hands once for 20 seconds after entering the house may have become common practice for most people in the age of COVID 19washing your hands multiple times for 20 minutes at a time is too often the response of people with OCDIt s that kind of overreaction that clinicians are worried is becoming too prevalentFor somebody with contamination issueswe would talk to them about hand washing upon entry of the homebut no other hand washing once you re in the confines of your homeWe tell them we re going to operate by CDCthe U SCenters for Disease Control and Preventionnot OCDsays clinical psychologist Anthony Pintoprogram director of the Northwell Health OCD Center on the campus of Long Island Jewish Medical CenterPinto also suggests that those with OCDpractice touchingpotentially contaminatedobjects in the home after washingRe exposing patients to perceived dangers like picking up mail or unwashed groceries and then resisting the urge to decontaminate a treatment approach known as exposure and response prevention (ERP) was a pillar of all OCD treatment long before the pandemic Read MoreAn N95 Is the Best Mask for OmicronHere s WhyThe problem with ERP in the era of the pandemic is thatat least at firstit was unclear if the exposure part of the process was actually dangerous or notIn the early days of COVID 19we opened doors with our elbowspushed shopping carts with our sleeves pulled down over our handsbumped elbows in greeting and stayed at least six feet apartEven now especially with the rise of Omicron no psychologist treating an OCD patient would recommend wading unmasked and untested into crowds of people whose viral status is unknownjust to toughen a patient s psyche against the anxiety caused by OCD What s moreERP is traditionally meant to be practiced in the supportive presence of a clinician a context that isn t necessarily comfortable or even available for many during the pandemicBut ERP practitioners have adaptedtelehealth sessions via Zoom and other platforms have exploded over the past two yearsand plenty of exercises can be done virtually and just as supportively on screen as in personIf a patient is afraid to sit on their bed after being outsidefor example we can work with that patient online to go outside and then come back in and sit on their bedthen lay on the bed with their street clothes onsays Pinto This is really geared towards experiential learning having the patient ride through that uncomfortable experience Things get trickier for people with the responsibility form of OCD the fear not of putting themselves in dangerbut of harming others like CharlesBefore home tests became availableevery sniffle Charles (not his real name) heard from his three year old son was an alarm signal to rush the boy to the doctor for yet another COVID 19 test involving an uncomfortable deep nose probeCharles argued for the testsbut his wife resistedWhen the boy didn t get testedCharles suffered inwardlyIpredictablyimagine doomsday scenarios whereby we wipe out his entire nursery school because we were cavalier about minor cold symptomshe says Stress exacerbates OCD in whatever form it takesand the greater anxiety becomesthe more people seek a perverse kind of comfort in their rituals We see in students who have OCDwhen it comes time for final exam periodthey re stressed and sometimes OCD symptoms get worsesays Wheaton They have developed this habitual response that when I m anxious and stressed outI turn to compulsionsbecause it s sort of a learned behavior to give me a sense of control Ultimatelythe pandemic will endbut for many people with OCDthe anxiety and precautions may not The driving force in OCD is the amygdala s distress signalit s not driven by new information from societysays Steven Phillipsonfounder and director of the Center for Cognitive Behavioral Psychotherapy in New York CityTwo years of contamination validation could take a long time to undoPinto worries that even as the rest of the world at last discards masks and forgets about social distancingpeople with OCD will continue to cling to old pandemic habits Those individuals were going to have a hard time adapting or trying to return to some normal activity because they want some assurance of 100safetyhe says The only way to have that assurance would be to remain shut down For some peoplehoweverthe trial by viral fire has actually been instructiveforcing them to deal with their OCD in ways they hadn t before The COVID era has exacerbated my OCD symptomsbut it s also been something of an opportunitysays Charles I have a long history with cognitive behavioral therapyand there has certainly been no shortage of chances to sharpen those skillsThe added stress has also led me to seek out a psychiatrist and a prescription for medicationwhich has been a big help as wellBut in the endhe adds with a rueful laugh would I do it all againHell no '},\n",

Insurance share their thoughts As the world slowly recovers from the Covid 19 pandemicfinancial services are slowly but steadily changing their way of doing business and also the way they engage and communicate with their consumers In the last 2 yearsthere has been a massive shift in the way consumers interact with the BankingFinancial Services and Insurance (BFSI) playersWith the change in consumer behaviorthere has also been a shift in the way these organizations are communicating with their consumersThere is a lot more empathythe last year has about putting the spotlight on courageresilience and hopeGoing ahead tooplayers in the BFSI sector will need to catch the pulse of the consumersand reach out to them at the touch points they are most comfortable atThe need of the hour also is to listen to consumersfigure out their pain points and try and solve themSeamless customer experience will play an intrinsic role in keeping brands top of mindThe future will be all about convenience and simplicity To understand a few larger trends we can expect to see in the BFSI sector in the year aheadwe reached out to some key playersand here is what they had to say I believe auser firstomni channelapproach to be a trend that marketers need to cater to 2022Let me elaborate my thoughts To be successfulbusiness organizations have to move in sync with larger trends seen in wider societyThese changes are often reflected in various elements such as popular culturetechnology adoption curvesenvironmental awarenessThe role of marketing is to identify such changes ahead of the curve align resources accordingly Consumers no longer look at old school structural boundaries but are more focused on the seamlessness of experience offered to them across touch pointsbe it a physical branch or an online platformThis is a trend commonly reflected across industriesas on a standalone basis neither model serves the customer needs wellWhen was the last time you saw an online payments intermediary get a physical banking licensean online medicine intermediary purchase a physical diagnostic chainan online insurance broker opening physical branchesretail stores with online integrationsThere are many such examples In the context of rapidly evolving business modelsmarketing capabilities hence need to be aligned towards building superior omni channel capabilities for customer acquisition lifecycle management There are three very interesting trends that I feel will dominate 2022 in post Covid Indian BFSI 1Social Discussion Forums where advanced users and experts handhold first time usersinformation seekerSeeds were sown during COVID when people dropped their inhibitions against digital financial transactionsonline investingInformation seekinghandholding was the logical next (first) step and that s what s going to be mainstream Going furtherneutral enabling platforms will equip potential customers with information and tools to make right choicesThese could also be offeredrun by an industry body or Governmentquasi government bodies (exampleMF Central mooted by SEBI)2AgentsBrokers connecting with customers through Video BotsThe evolution mentioned in point 1 above will further lead to distributors of financial products connecting with potential customers through video bots on social media wherein questions can be askedindividual proposals can be sentappointments sought and transactions concluded through bots 3Social Commerce 2 0 with Meta Insta leading the wayShopping while consuming social media seemed like an alien concept in early 20s but it is clearly how the consumers prefer itwant it and desire itWe all saw the string response Meta generated and I am sure brands would be hatching their plans to leverage this trend Uncertainty will remain a way of lifein the foreseeable futureBut as they saytough times are the true test of characterand in these timesit holds equally true for a brand While there will be a temptation to lay low and see how the uncertainty pans outsuch times will help sift the men from the boysHe who sows during this timewill reap the mostNowAnd hereafter Towards this end aspray and prayapproach will not helpBrands will have to keep a finger on the customer s pulsebe it their feltor even unfelt (as yet) needsBrands that can anticipate the customer s need will have to offer relevancesimplicityand comfort in these ever changing timesSpeed to market will become a barometer of success While anticipating the customer s future needsI believe that a brand must not place all its bets only on the digital worldThe customer will want and will exercise a choiceHigh touch and high techAs he wants itwhen he wants it At the end of the daythe customer remains the king and the brand that not merely listensbut makes its customers feel heard for all their said and unsaid needsin the times like thesewill live to narrate the tale While Banks have been consistently trying to engage thenew to bankinggeneration Gen Z and late millennialsbuilding a stronger connection with them will be a key trend for banks in the coming yearAs digital nativesthis audience has naturally come to expect digital first experiences that are seamless across apps and platformsThereforetheir expectation from banking is significantly different a near instant fulfilment which the banks will need to accommodate through products and servicesin order to address this shift in behaviour To offer a differentiated banking suite that meets these expectationsbanks will need to create simplistic and personalized solutions that can come alive by re imagining customer journeys for this segmentUsing purpose driven marketing that appeals to their emotional motivators their beliefsdrivers and cultural environment banks can cater to the experiences they are looking forIn sync with thisevolving the design language and communicationwith a focus on simplicity and relatabilitywill help establish a lasting connect Customer experiencedata protection and social consciousness will be the three dominant trends for the BFSI sector in 2022 The last two years of the pandemic have recast customer expectations from brand experiences across various platformsIn line with these changesbrands will work on building consistency in CXirrespective of the purchase or service channelThey will also make efforts on easing access to insurance by continuing to invest in multi channel capabilities While the pandemic has bolstered the digital opportunityit has also raised concerns over data protectionAs data becomes increasingly important for businessesthere is an improving awareness among customers regarding data privacyWith giants like Google and Apple making first move towards data protectionthere is a looming threat to the efficacy of marketing campaignsBrands will proactively craft inclusive data protection strategies so that customers can stay in control of their data Lastlybrands will increasingly align with a social purpose that best reflects their brand valuesOf all the social initiativesEnvironmentSustainability and Corporate Governance will be higher on priority list The pandemic has made people realise that uncertainty in life is a reality and not just a sales pitchGiven thatthe realisation of the need for insurance has increasedespecially for term and health insuranceWe have seen demand risingnot just in the metros and Tier 1 cities but even in the smaller towns and rural areasWith reduced spending on lifestyle expensespeople have greater disposable income in hand which they are keen on investing in financial instruments such as life insurance Parents tooare increasingly keen on investing in child plansFindings from our recentFutureFearless survey have shown that the pandemic has influenced Indian parents to rethink their financial health and priorities for their childrenSaving for their children s educationfuture and milestones has emerged as the top priority for parentsalong with saving for medical emergencies In 2022as an industrywe need to further capitalise on this demandUsing various platformsespecially the cost effective digital mediumwe need to further educate people and create awareness on the role of insurance in financially securing themselves and their families against life s uncertaintieswhile allowing them to pursue their dreams The pandemic has taught us that communication is of utmost importance not just for your customersbut also for other stakeholders including employeesGoing forwardsimplicity and authenticitywill be the most important part of all communicationWhile inclination towards digitization is increasingprint is not going awayin fact I see it making a strong come backDigital media is surely the future and I see another year where this belief is reinforced furtherIn factwe re already listening to talks of OTT platforms of news channelswhich might be something totally new with custom contentOn the internal communications sideas always it remains as a tool which helps organizations provide right information to their employeesHoweverI feel that it will also play a role of culture builder wherein it will no longer be restricted to communications or HR teambut various other functions getting involved in itWith complex business modelswe ll see custom built communications

committed this yearHigher carbon prices and environmental taxes increase production costs for industrialswhile under investment in fossil fuels has contributed to a spike in energy costs that

identity verification as well as verifying the presence location of peopleStarting as tangential to public safety and homeland securitythe social credit market becomes mainstream by2026Social credit systems represent the ability to identify (mostly people but also some \"things\") and track activities for purposes of grading behaviors and applying \"social credit\" scoringA given grading scoring methodology depends largely on social credit system objectives and metrics Howevermost systems will have socially acceptable behaviour at their coreThis presents both a challenge and an opportunity as a combination of governmentcompaniesand society as a whole must determine \"good\"\"bad\"and \"marginal\" behavior within the social credit market Beginning as a trend largely orthogonal to public safety and homeland security concernsthe market for social credit system infrastructure will ultimately become a mainstream component of both business and public policy This means that systems will ultimately be used for a variety of commerce and lifestyle related issues ranging from risk assessment (access to creditfinancing feesinsuranceetc ) to accessibility within public places such as concertssporting eventsand other assembliesHigh social scoring individuals within the social credit market will be granted preferred access to both real and digital assets Social credit system infrastructure includes analogue and digital surveillanceInternet enabled devices like smartphoneswearable devicessecurity systemssensor enabled physical objectsand surveillance devices that use biometrics and computer visionTechnologies include broadband wireless (WiFiLTEand 5G)IoTAI algorithmsand big data analytics platformsprocessesand procedures While each of these systems has market value individuallyand are deployed separately for various purposesit is the convergence of these otherwise disparate technologies that will facilitate value within the social credit marketFor examplecombined AI and IoT systems will be leveraged to identify important events that require immediate action versus those that are merely archived It is important to note that there is great overlap between the technologies used for social credit systems and other solutions such as public safetyhomeland securityand smart cities applications of many types including smart transportation (highways and surface streetsparkingautonomous vehiclesetc )intelligent buildingsenvironmental monitoring (lighttemperaturepressureetc )Many of these infrastructure elements are already planned for

equipment and platforms including sensorsbiometricscamerasand other optical devicescomputer vision systemsand other advanced computing platforms Cyberinfrastructure includes platformsdevicesand software to support data processing and correlation with identity informationwhich shall leverage AIIoTand advanced data analyticsThe main purpose for all the aforementioned infrastructure elements is to capture datawhich must be stored and acted upon as appropriate At the heart of social creditsystems are large scale data repositories that may store virtually any type of data that may be correlated to or associated with citizens and businesses in terms of both identity and behaviors This includes raw observational data as well as listings (whitegreyredand black) and meta data to tie together data elements and allow for ease of information queriesWithout the use of AI and big data technologyit would be problematic to implement social credit market systems in a meaningful way as

attractive Up to 60of Nissan cars produced at its Thai factory were exported to Japan last yearsaid Mr Sekiguchi The auto industry has an opportunity to increase sales as a result of changes in travel behaviourhe saidMany people are avoiding public transport for fear of contracting the virusThis is likely to translate into more car salessaid Mr Sekiguchi Even sales of electric vehicles (EVs)which are more expensive than oil powered carsincreased during the pandemiche saidThis trend is in line with Nissan s Ambition 2030 campaignwhich aims to direct the company towards more EV production The company plans to launch 23 new electric modelsincluding 15 new EVsaiming for 50electric models by 2030according to Nissan Motor Corporation s websiteThe pandemic caused people to become more aware of the environment and the impact of air pollutionsaid Mr Sekiguchi Creating an EV industry in Thailand is still a challenge because more investment in EV infrastructure is neededhe saidNissan plans to wait and see when local customers are ready to buy EVsPeople in Thailand are being educated about EVssaid Mr Sekiguchi CLEAN ENERGY FUTURESET listed electronics component manufacturing firm Delta Electronics said digital transformationproper public infrastructure for EV manufacturing and clean energy generation are the keys to shaping a better future for Thailand Mr Chang said Thailand s continuous progress in becoming a smart city is helping the manufacturing sector thrive5G is playing a big role in ThailandAs 5G expandsit helps Thailand become a smart cityespecially in different provincesSmart manufacturing also comes into play in order to increase the supply chainhe said Mr Chang said 5G connectivity in Thailand in telecommunications and at data centres is crucial for business because many of them have adapted and implemented theThink GlobalAct Localstrategy during the pandemic to avoid disruption from supply chain issuessuch as the semiconductor shortage This strategy is also known as decentralised manufacturingThe strategy involves using cutting edge technologies to set up operations and then run facilities at their optimal rate For exampleit allows Delta Electronics to collaborate seamlessly with partners in Thailand to assemble parts for any products without delays related to shipping or shortageshe said Mr Chang said Thailand should also step up its efforts on sustainable development and set up proper infrastructure for the private sector to support EV manufacturing and clean energy generationInfrastructure for EVs needs to be more populated around the countryWe are working with our partner Nissan to push this issue in the Thai marketin terms of public infrastructurehe saidWe also believe electrification and clean energy in Thailand could be improvedcreating an easier and freer marketIt needs to be easier to trade energy so we can build more solar plants and wind turbinescreating clean energy here As for the coronavirus impact on Delta ElectronicsbusinessMr Chang said the firm recorded a 30 year peak this past SeptemberThe company has been vaccinating its workers and equipping them with digital training '},\n",

Moorethe Toyota deal was okayBoth men issued statements endorsing it andof courseclaiming creditbut through it allthey continued to refuse to even acknowledge the climate elephant in the roomMaybe it s just habitAfter allboth men have beeneffectivelydenying the existence of climate change and advancing policies to prevent the state from taking action to address it for well over a decadeAnd then there are thefree market fundamentalistsat the Raleigh based John Locke FoundationAs you may recallthis is a group thatfor decadesdenied the reality of climate change and or its connection to fossil fuel consumptionNot only has the group panned the Toyota deal based on its longstanding opposition to economic incentives (even as it parroted the inaccurate claims of Berger and Moore that GOP tax cuts were the deciding factor)but it has repeatedly argued in tandem with its long time allies in the fossil fuel industry that electric vehicles are a fraudIndeedthe group seems so desperate to undermine fossil fuel competition that it has even resorted to borrowing progressive stances on other issues to do soIn a video the group released earlier this year featuring a man who long served as one of industry s favorite (de)regulators former state Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Donald van der Vaart electric vehicles are slammed because of the environmental damage that is caused by mining the minerals needed for batteries and get this the poor treatment of the minersThisfrom a groupthat s scarcely ever met an environmental or worker protection regulation it didn t want to repealIt s also ironic that right wing trolls on Facebook and Twitter are all of a sudden worried about toxic pollution that might result from this EV battery plantSuch hypocrisy trickles down from groups like JLF on a daily basisbut pointing it out can be exhausting https www yourdailyjournal com opinion 104513 rob schofield toyota deal highlights issue confronti THE BAD GUYS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

fake accountsBut the standard doesn t capture a host of other harms also organized by malignant networksMeta is adjusting in an attempt to keep upDecember s report homes in on two new categories that Meta is targeting for disruptionbrigadingandmass reportingBoth of these terms of service breaches are routinely carried out by real accounts in addition to fake onesand both of them do something more than the typical flooding of the information space with lies or propagandaThey attempt also to silence those they disagree with by drowning them outBrigading means commenting or posting repetitively and at volume to harass or silence othersTakefor instanceMeta s removal of a network in Italy and France linked to an anti vaccination movement known as V_VIn this casethe brigadiers planned on messaging platform Telegram to intimidate doctorsjournalists and media out of discussing coronavirus vaccinationWhere one vicious or misleading post might not have much of an impacta thousand can make someone never want to speak up again and intimidate those who identify with a bombarded individualMass reportingby contrastinvolves cooperating to get others incorrectly booted off FacebookMeta points to a network in Vietnam that conspired to stymie the speech of government critics by flagging posts for various rules violationsSometimesthe network would even set up accounts impersonating targets and then report the targets for impersonating themThis is a new way for people in power to shut down people who seek to challenge itI know it s in style to blame Zuck for everything going wrong in the

increasesUNC should consider moving classes online for the first few weeks of the semesterThis provides the opportunity for students who traveled throughout the break to quarantine or stagger their return to campusAdditionallyonce classes have resumedit s imperative to implement flexible attendance policiesas well offering hybrid formats for larger lecturesStudents and professors should be given greater autonomy over their mode of instruction to fit the health and safety needs of themselves and the classTestingonce againis the answer to preventing clusters on campusUNC should expand their asymptomatic testing hours and locationsincluding an off campus location for students living across Chapel Hill and CarrboroRandom surveillance testing must be implemented for thosevaccinated and unvaccinated and the frequency of testing for unvaccinated individuals must increase as wellAdditionallymask mandates must be enforced thoroughlyIf you look around during a Carolina Basketball gameyou

Moorethe Toyota deal was okayBoth men issued statements endorsing it andof courseclaiming creditbut through it allthey continued to refuse to even acknowledge the climate elephant in the roomMaybe it s just habitAfter allboth men have beeneffectivelydenying the existence of climate change and advancing policies to prevent the state from taking action to address it for well over a decadeAnd then there are thefree market fundamentalistsat the Raleigh based John Locke FoundationAs you may recallthis is a group thatfor decadesdenied the reality of climate change and or its connection to fossil fuel consumptionNot only has the group panned the Toyota deal based on its longstanding opposition to economic incentives (even as it parroted the inaccurate claims of Berger and Moore that GOP tax cuts were the deciding factor)but it has repeatedly argued in tandem with its long time allies in the fossil fuel industry that electric vehicles are a fraudIndeedthe group seems so desperate to undermine fossil fuel competition that it has even resorted to borrowing progressive stances on other issues to do soIn a video the group released earlier this year featuring a man who long served as one of industry s favorite (de)regulators former state Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Donald van der Vaart electric vehicles are slammed because of the environmental damage that is caused by mining the minerals needed for batteries and get this the poor treatment of the minersThisfrom a groupthat s scarcely ever met an environmental or worker protection regulation it didn t want to repealIt s also ironic that right wing trolls on Facebook and Twitter are all of a sudden worried about toxic pollution that might result from this EV battery plantSuch hypocrisy trickles down from groups like JLF on a daily basisbut pointing it out can be exhausting https www yourdailyjournal com opinion 104513 rob schofield toyota deal highlights issue confronti THE BAD GUYS ON SOCIAL MEDIA

Meta is targeting for disruptionbrigadingandmass reportingBoth of these terms of service breaches are routinely carried out by real accounts in addition to fake onesand both of them do something more than the typical flooding of the information space with lies or propagandaThey attempt also to silence those they disagree with by drowning them outBrigading means commenting or posting repetitively and at volume to harass or silence othersTakefor instanceMeta s removal of a network in Italy and France linked to an anti vaccination movement known as V_VIn this casethe brigadiers planned on

to a network in Vietnam that conspired to stymie the speech of government critics by flagging posts for various rules violationsSometimesthe network would even set up accounts impersonating targets

limiting third party dataalong with concerns about misinformationhave already started to swing the tide back towards trusted brandsbut advertising remains a competitive and challenging businessand not every publisher will thrive On the business sidemany traditional news organisations remain relentlessly focused on faster digital transformation as rising newsprint and energy costs look to make print

journalists should behave in social media In many parts of the worldaudiences for news media have been falling throughout 2021 not an ideal situation at a time when accurate and reliable information has been so critical to people s health and securityA key challenge for the news media this year is to re engage those who have turned away from news as well as to build deeper relationships with more regular news consumers 2022 will be a year of careful consolidation for a news industry that has been both disrupted and galvanised by the drawn out COVID 19 crisisBoth journalists and audiences haveto some degreebeenburnt outby the relentless intensity of the news agendaalongside increasingly polarised debates about politicsidentityand cultureThis could be the year when journalism takes a breathfocuses on the basicsand comes back stronger 1The business of journalism is looking up for someOne of the biggest surprises in this year s survey is the growth in revenue reported by many publishersWell over half our sample (59 )which includes both subscription and advertising focused publishers from more than 50 countriessay that overall revenues have increasedwith only 8reporting that things had got worseThis is despite the continuing COVID 19 pandemic and the further erosion of traditional revenue sources such as print In many ways this is testament to the adaptability of an industry that has accelerated new digital revenue streams such as subscriptione commerceand digital events over the past 18 months and also started to bring in substantial licensing revenue from tech platforms on topFor all publishersa key element in this has been a strong bounce back in digital advertisingas consumers moved their spending online during the ongoing pandemicDigital advertising grew at its fastest rate ever (30year on year) in 2021 according to GroupM and now accounts for around two thirds (64 ) of all advertising spend It is worth remembering that many publishers not represented in our survey still rely on traditional and declining revenue sources such as print and even broadcastAnd for those without a clear digital path ahead of themthe outlook remains extremely challenging At the same timeoverall consumption of online news has fallen significantly in some countriesincluding the UK and the United Statesfollowing the dramas of the Trump eraaccording to industry dataThe relentless and depressing nature of the news has been a factorwith many consumers looking to social media and streaming services for entertainment and distraction In our own surveycovering a wide range of countrieswe find a more mixed pictureAlthough the majority (54 ) report static or declining traffic to online news sitesmore than four in ten (44 ) say their traffic has gone up Overallthe majority of publishers (73 ) say are optimistic about the year aheadEven if traffic is down in some casesjournalists feel that their role is more valued by audiences and the business side in particular is on a more solid footing Journalism is no longer being taken for grantedThe industry is explaining itself better and money is flowing proportionately to economic growth David WalmsleyEditor in ChiefGlobe and Mail CanadaLevels of confidence in journalism more generally (60 ) are a bit lowerespecially in countries where there is political polarisationeconomic weaknessand where journalists themselves are under attack The power of governments against free press or journalism is growing in Latin America (especially Mexico)The president can say whatevereven if he is openly lyingpress debunking or explaining the lie has little effectby comparison Senior journalistMexicoWe ll come back to the pressures on journalists later in this report 1 1 Subscription and membership models matureA key part of publisher confidence has been the continued growth of subscription and membership models through the COVID 19 pandemicThe New York Times now has 8 4 million subscriptionsof which 7 6 million are digitalputting it on track to hit its 10 million target by 2025 For many of these early moversdigital revenue now outstrips print and many upmarket titles can see a path to a sustainable futureBut so too can a number of smaller digital born publishers with significant reader revenuessuch as Dennik N in SlovakiaEl Diario in SpainMalaysiakini in MalaysiaZetland in Denmarkand the Daily Maverick in South Africa The opportunity for growth at the company level is there for usWe see the path and prospects clearly now with sustainable revenue model in place Styli CharalambousCEODaily MaverickSouth AfricaSubscription remains the number one priority (79 ) for commercial publishers in 2022according to our surveyahead of display advertising (73 ) and native advertising (59 )events (40 ) and funding from platforms (29 )which has grown significantly over the last year The jury is still out on whether subscription models will work for allAlternatives are being pursued by publications such as BuzzFeed and Voxworking across a range of brands to give them more scaleThese brands still see a future with a mix of models from advertisingto e commerceand even reader payment tooOnce againour survey shows there is no one size fits all modelAdvertising continues to be the main focus for manyand commercial publishers citeon averagethree or four different revenue streams as being important or very important to them this year Free at the point of consumption models will also be important in ensuring that news is not just for elitesAlmost half of news leaders (47 ) worry that subscription models may be pushing journalism towards super serving richer and more educated audiences and leaving others behindMany leaders of PSBs and others committed to open journalism are amongst those who disagree with this statementbut our own research shows that even these organisations are struggling to build connections with younger and less educated groups online What will happen this year Open access initiativesExpect more deals for those from disadvantaged backgrounds as a way of countering critiques about growing information inequalityThe Daily Maverick in South Africa offers apay what you can affordmembership and El Diario in Spain allows people to pay nothing at allIn Portugallottery funding has been used to fund 20 000 free digital news

educational institutions Making subscriptions more accessibleMaverick Insider a slider to pay what you can affordFree subscriptions via the Portuguese lotteryCountering subscription fatigue via product extensions and bundlingThis will be a key focus for many publishers looking to hang on to new subscribers gained during COVIDCut price offers and differential pricing will be one likely responseespecially if the economy cuts up roughbut others are looking to develop new premium products to encourage tie inThe New York Times has led the field with the success of its crosswords and cooking appsNow it has moved its product review siteWirecutterbehind a paywall and has also started offering previously free newsletters from star writers like Kara Swisher only to subscribersOther publishers are looking to bundle paid podcasts and audio books 1 2 The creator economy and the battle for talentOver the last few yearswe have seen the coming together of two powerful ideasThe first is that online journalism needs to be paid for and the second that journalists may need to behave more like social influencers as they build relationships and communities These ideas are embodied in new platforms like Substackwhich along with new product offerings from giant tech companies have enabled individual writersvloggersand podcasters to make significant amounts of moneyinjecting new life into the so calledcreator economyIn November Substack announced that it had hit the milestone of 1 million paid subscriptionswith top writers earning six figure sums from its newsletter focused platformBoth Facebook (Bulletin) and Twitter (Revue) have launched their own competitors to Substackalong with a range of other features to incentivise creatorsTwitterfor examplein September 2021 launched a Super Follows subscription feature (think bonus tweets) that helps creators earn money from their most engaged fansFacebook introduced fan subscriptions and starsboth mechanisms that provide financial rewards for the most engaging contentMeanwhile podcast platforms are enabling similar features with a subscription or donation offer on top of a free serviceThese developments are setting up new dynamics around who gets attention and what content may be prioritised in years to come Twitter Super Follows featureFacebook Starsand newsletter and podcast subscriptionsWhat will happen this year Mainstream media poaches backIf last year s trend was star writers setting up on their ownthis year we may see more movement in the opposite directionNot all writers have found it easy to grow an audience quickly on their own and traditional companies are looking to hoover up talent as a way of feeding subscription pipelinesThe Atlanticfor exampleis launching a suite of new newsletters including writers like Charlie Warzelwho previously operated his Galaxy Brain brand on SubstackWriters can continue to earn money independently from podcasts and personal appearances and existing followers get a year s free access to The Atlanticafter which they will need to subscribe Journalism collectives as a halfway houseThis year we may see more companies that try to mix the infrastructure of a traditional news organisations with the freedom and financial rewards they can find on their own Puck is a start up founded by a former editor of Vanity Fair Jon Kellywho has brought together a set of writers to cover Silicon ValleyHollywoodWashingtonand Wall Street There is an elite group of journalists who want to have a direct connection with the large audiences they ve amassed on social channelssays KellyFounding partners own part of the business but also get bonuses based on the subscriptions and ad sales they generateFor an annual feeconsumers get access to emails across a range of subjects but can also pay a premium for events and personal access to writers Connecting writers pay to subscriptionsThis is likely to become an increasingly contentious issue this year as media companies rely more on star talent to generate revenue from readersPuck has an algorithm that works out how to reward those driving most revenue but transparency and fairness will be testedCasey Newtonone of the current Substack starsthinks that publishers will eventually need to offer shared revenue on newsletters or video sponsorships or podcast ads I expect lots of thrashing from journalists who think they have the right to experiment with Super Follows and other creator monetisation tools and publishers who want to shut them down All this activity is creating more and more contentbut the big question is whether there are enough people with sufficient interest to pay for all but the star writers and podcasters 1 3 Make or break year for digital media brandsIt wasn t that long ago that BuzzFeed and a few other digital native brandssuch as Vox and Vicelooked like the future of the news businessSky high valuations were fuelled by a generation of writers comfortable with digital culturewho invented a set of formats that matched rising consumer enthusiasm for social consumption But this open accessad supported model has taken a knock following various Facebook algorithm changescompounded by the shock of coronavirusSome of the stars of digital media have defected back to old media companies and many venture capitalists (VCs) are looking to get their money backThe original disrupters are now caught in a battle with resurgent legacy media for general readers and with platforms for advertising dollars What will happen this year Digital natives go for scaleBuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti has argued for years that digital publishers should consolidate to give them more leverage with advertisers and compete with the ad dominance of Facebook and GoogleBuzzFeed s move to go publiccompleted in December 2021provided the cash to acquire digital lifestyle publisher Complexfollowing last year s purchase of HuffPostNow all eyes will be on ViceVoxand Bustle as they contemplate similar movesVox bought New York Magazine and its websites in 2019 and has just acquired Group Nine (owner of multiple brands including NowThis and PopSugar)By year end we can expect more M A activity but perhaps not the mega merger that was predicted some years ago Traditional media look to acquisition to fuel growthThe biggest players will be looking for digital brands that can add value to their subscription bundles and bring different types of audienceAxel Springer purchased Politico last year for around1bn and the New York Times has agreed to buy subscription based sports site The Athleticin a deal valued at around550 millionThe Athletic has built built more than 1 million subscribers based on deep reporting in multiple sporting niches Local start ups fuelled by new modelsAt a local levelwe can expect to see the growth of low cost reader focused start ups this yearbuilt on newsletter platforms like Substackwhich help take out technology and infrastructure costs The Manchester Millwhich launched during the height of COVID lockdownshas generated almost 1 000 paying subscriptions at7 a month in the last year for a mix of slow journalism delivered mainly by newsletterA certain amount of free content gives it a much wider readership and there is now an offshoot in printSuper users engage with the editorial team on a Facebook group providing ideas for storiesAnd there is a podcast too A sister titlethe Sheffield Tribune has gained around 300 subscribers and a thirdThe Posthas just launched covering Liverpool Meanwhile in the United StatesAxios has plans to expand its newsletter led model to 25 cities by mid 2022 with 100 soon afterAxios reporters will break local newshold local officials accountable and offer tips for navigating local areas and hopes that this reader supported (membership) model can eventually reachevery community in America 2Audience strategies and publisher innovationFollowing the shock of COVIDthe key mood in our survey this year seems to be around consolidation when it comes to product developmentAlthough some media companies are focusing on advertising and others on subscriptionthe success of both models ultimately depends on deeper engagement with audiences via websitesappsnewslettersand podcasts In terms of audience facing innovationmost effort this year will go into podcasts and other digital audio (80 )followed by building and revamping newsletters (70 ) and developing digital video formats (63 )By contrast shiny new thingsinvolving technology that has not yet reached maturitysuch as applications for voice (14 ) and the metaverse (8 ) appear to be largely on the backburner 2 1 Audio everywhereGrowing consumption of digital audio has been a trend for a few yearsdriven by a combination of smartphonesbetter headphonesand investment in podcasts from platforms like SpotifyGoogleand AmazonBut in the last year we ve seen the rapid development of a much wider range of digital formats such as audio articlesflash briefingsand audio messagesalong with live formats such as social audio The rise (and fall) of Clubhouseknown as the firstairpods social networkhas been well documented but almost all the major platformssuch as Twitter (Spaces)Facebook (Live Audio Rooms)Reddit (Talk)quickly produced clones to allow users to create impromptu discussion and eventsThe jury remains out on how compelling audiences will find these features when the hype dies down More widelythe platforms are investing in tools to allow consumers to create and edit their own short audio stories effectively delivering another layer of the creator economyFacebook Meta are buildingsoundbitesa new creativeshort form audio format that will appear across all their products a sort of TikTok for audio Audio is going to be a first class mediumEvery once in a whilea new medium comes along that can be adopted into a lot of different areas Mark ZuckerbergCEO FacebookMeanwhile audio messaging and communication is gaining traction and finding a new home in a range of apps from cooking to datingShort audio messages attached to dating profiles within Hinge have added a sense of personality beyond photos and bios and many have gone viral ClubhouseFacebook soundbites and Hinge dating voice promptsImplications for journalismPlatform investments in audio are opening up the medium to anyone with a smartphone and a story to tellbut this is likely to create a set of familiar problems for publishersMore content means more competition for attention and it may be harder for professional content to stand outOn the other handit may also stimulate listening overallenabling more opportunities for consumption and connectionFor platformsthere will be new content moderation challenges in a medium even harder to monitor than written text In our conversations around trends and predictionsit is clear that many publishers believe that audio offers better opportunities for both engagement and monetisation than they can get through similar investments in text or videoAt least in the United Statespodcast CPMs have been buoyant through the pandemic with the New York Times making36m from podcast ads according to their 2020 resultsEqually important though is the value in marketing and attracting new audiencesTortoise Mediawhich has pivoted heavily towards audioended the year with the No1 podcast on the Apple Podcast charts in the United StatesSweet Bobbyintroducing many more people to the brandincluding much sought after younger listeners What will happen this year in audio More publishers look to become audio destinations of their ownWith audio becoming more centralthe battle is on between competing platforms and publishers to control the full customer experienceThe New York Times is planning to launch a listening product this year which will include article narrations from Audm including stories from rival publicationsand shows from Serial Productionsboth of which it bought in 2020It is also likely to include the 25 year archive from public radio programme This American LifeIt is also possible that it will feature a long expected afternoon version of The Dailythe hit podcast that has more than 20 million listeners monthlyIn developing the appthe Times has spent identified keymomentswhere consumers may be open to audio only experiences and its analysis shows that the current offer (in blue) is only scratching the surface The new NYT audio app started with identifying moments in theAudio Daythat could be filled by great content of different lengthsThe new app may end up part of the Times subscription bundleor at least in a premium layer within itThis is another key reason why audio is seen as strategically importantIt can deliver reachloyaltyand revenue in equal measureSchibsted is also building free and premium audio products in Nordic countriesfollowing the acquisition of Swedish platform PodMeand says that audiowhich includes podcastsbooksand short form contentis now a core part of its overall strategy Elsewheresome public broadcasters have been considering whether to host podcast content from other publishers and are withholding their best content from the big tech platforms for a period of time Second coming for paid podcast platformsPaid features from Apple and Spotify will open up the market this year for individual creators and publishers alike this yearUnlike AppleSpotify is not taking a cut for the first two years in a bid to encourage the best talentOptions include offering a mix of free and paid contentincluding bonus episodes for super fansIndependent podcast platforms are also quietly creating alternativesespecially in smaller marketsPodimo has 100 000paying subscribers for high quality local language content in countries like DenmarkNorwayGermanyand Spainand has secured funding for further expansion of a model where it shares membership fees with those creating the contentBut with publishers joining platforms looking for the best exclusive content expect the price to go up this yearespecially for the biggest stars 2 2 Get set for another pivot to videoThe first pivot to video was partly driven by new social media formats like Facebook Livebut quickly faded after the platforms lost interestNow live video is booming againpartly fuelled by COVID news conferences and dramatic events like the storming of the US Capitolwhile short form video has been revitalised by the creativity and dynamic growth of TikTok Publishers are stepping up investmentwith NBCas one exampleadding 200 new positions and several new hours of programming for its NBC News NOW service which also feeds the Peacock streaming serviceIt has also invested heavily in short form video reaching tens of millions of Gen Z viewers with its Stay Tuned programming on Snapchat Meanwhile TikTok now reaches more than a billion people around the worldaccording to the companyUsers have been captivated by its mix of musichumour (and news) driven by a powerfulFor Youfeed generated by an algorithm that learns what you likeIn turn this success has led Facebook and YouTube to step up development of their own copycat formats (Reels and Shorts)further fuelling creation and promotion of this content Our own Digital News Report found that TikTok now reaches a quarter (24 ) of under 35swith 7using the platform for news even more in parts of Asia and South AmericaBut our research also found thatwhen it comes to newsit is mainly influencers and celebrities that people are paying attention to raising questions about how and whether journalists and news brands should engage on this platform Why does this matter for journalism Publishers are increasingly worried about how to attract younger audiences and many see native video formats as part of the answerThe Swedish Public Broadcaster SVT is now the number one destination for a quarter (26 ) of Swedes aged between 20 and 29 years old up from just 9in 2017Much of that change is due to investment in a range of mobile friendly online video formats that get to the point quickly or address non traditional subjectsOther public broadcasters like Germany s ARD have been experimenting with creating more bespoke video content for third party platforms like TikTok and Instagram In our surveywe can see a clear change in direction in terms of the third party platforms being prioritised this yearPublishers say they will be putting much more effort into Instagram (net score of54)TikTok ( 44)and YouTube ( 43)all networks that lead with visual and video contentand less effort into general purpose networks like Twitter ( 5) and Facebook ( 8) What will happen this year in video Influencers build mass audiences via networks like TwitchIbai Llanosa Spanish influencer with 7 million followers on the gaming platform Twitchsecured the first interview with footballer Lionel Messi after his transfer to Paris Saint Germainoutcompeting traditional broadcast journalistsMore than 300 000 people watched the original broadcastwith more accessing on demandLlanos is an example of a new generation of entrepreneurial stars who are creating and monetising their communities across a number of platformsPoliticians are also looking to interact on a platform that is especially popular with e sports fans and young men French Prime Minister and Lionel Messi on TwitchNews on TikTok remains a battlegroundPublishers looking to crack the code of TikTok s bite sized videos are being shown the way by a Spanish start upAc2ality has built up around 3 million followers on TikTok for a service that includes a one minute round up of top storiesThat s more followers than the Washington Post and the BBC combinedWith more news on TikTokexpect more false and misleading information tooThe Institute for Strategic Dialogue recently tracked vaccine misinformation on the platform and found that just over 100 posts had got more than 20 million views thanks to TikTok s powerful algorithm and unique audio features designed for viralitySome outside observers continue to worry that the Chinese owned platform will take a different approach to content moderation on politically sensitive topics than its US owned competitors One start up looking to counter misinformation on TikTok and other social platforms is the News Movementfounded by former executives from Dow Jones and the BBCThe service aims to deliver trustworthy and objective information in 2022 to mass audiences on social mediawith accessible video

publishers are looking to cash inwith NBCUniversal experimenting with a show on Instagramwhile TikTok has hosted a two day live streamed event in the UK with influencersmusicand a quizMeanwhileSnap is investing in augmented reality technology to help users virtually try on items like watches and jewellery The big question is whether any of this will work for news publishersPrevious attempts to monetise short form social video have proved unsuccessfulwhile e commerce is most suited to lifestyle brands and breaking news is largely commoditisedDespite thisCNN has taken a brave decision to put its live stream behind a paywall as part of a CNNservice that will include exclusive on demand showsMany other broadcasters will be looking carefully at how that works out in 2022 2 3 Publishers identify blockers to innovationMost survey respondents are clear that the main focus this year should be on iterating and improving existing products (67 )rather than investing in new technologies or services (32 )This is partly because publishers have less money available for risky investments but also because most publishers now have a clear path on which they are setA good starting point is to ensure that existing digital products are as seamless and engaging as those produced by tech platformsNews products have often fallen far short In terms of specific initiativesa number of publishers talked about the need to replace legacy appsoptimise subscription pipelinesand upgrade their data infrastructureWhile most are focusing on the corewe also find a small minority of well funded leading edge publishers pushing hard for growthstrengthening their business models through brand extensions and acquisitionsThe New York Times has found growth with cookingcrosswordsand shoppingand others are looking to adopt similar approaches Innovation is becoming a more important part in our growth strategy as we try to go beyond thecore CTO at a successful subscription publisherInnovation blockers in the year aheadPublishers recognise that innovation is critical in making sure that they stay relevant as audience behaviours continue to shiftBut our survey suggests thatalthough the strategy is often cleardelivering planned improvements can be a different issue Around half (51 ) of our sample of publishers say that they don t have enough money to invest in innovation this yearpartly due to budget cuts imposed during COVIDA similar proportion say they are struggling to hire or keep enough technicaldesignor data staff to deliver solutionsIn our Changing Newsrooms report we found the biggest concerns about talent were around software engineers and data scientists Another major barrier to innovation highlighted by the survey includes lack of alignment (41 ) between different departments such as editorialmarketingcommercialand technologyWe have previously highlighted how the vertically siloed nature of many media companies makes it particularly difficult to deliver innovation that needs cross functional teams to work in a common process We re now in an age of mature product departmentssays Chris MoranHead of Editorial Innovation at the Guardian But we still need to work to find the right balance between the rigour of product methodologies and processes and the specific editorial expertise of a given publisher Moran argues thatif organisations want to innovate the processthey should not start with shiny new technologies like VR or AI It s about the right technology applied intelligently in ways that tie to our values and expertiseThat way we will build genuinely unique features and products that differentiate us from platforms and their associated problems 3The practice of journalismhybrid newsroomsgenerational changeand new agendasAlmost two years into the pandemic many newsrooms are unrecognisablesome remain largely emptyBut journalists are also struggling to cope with burnout from a relentless news cycle which has often impacted their own healthattacks by politiciansharassment on social mediaand the isolation that comes with working from homeBehind the scenes much has changedA new generation of leaders is taking over with a new agenda and more inclusive approach 3 1 Hybrid working becomes the normAssuming that the virus is finally brought under controlthis will be the year when hybrid working with some people in the office and others working remotely becomes the normOur Changing Newsrooms report in November found that news organisations are pressing ahead with plans to redesign officesupgrade technologyreduce desk space office spaceand renegotiate contracts with employees to accommodate this shiftOver the next year we can expect most employees to spend two to three days a week in the office and the rest at home Yet our report also found that the full implications of the hybrid newsroom have not been fully worked throughThe experience so far has been good for efficiencybut publishers worry about losses to creativitycollaborationand communication (3Cs) What can we expect this year More fully virtual news organisationsExpect to see more publishers closing offices entirelyor at least moving in that directionLast summerthe business focused publication Quartz announced it was becoming afully distributed companyThis means it will employ anyone from anywhereopening up the talent pool and reducing costsThough Quartz has kept the lease on its New York office for another yearthe assumption is thatin terms of meetings even when you are at the officeeveryone is remotesays CEO Zach Seward Hot to run a hybrid meetingSourceQZ at work Meanwhile in the UKregional publisher Reach has closed 75of its officesturning staff into remote workerswhile another publisherArchantis closing two thirds of its offices by March 2022arguing that home working is now the preferred option for most employees This risks undermining company culture but may be more equitable than hybrid environmentswhereproximity biascan favour those prepared to show their face in the office every dayHybrid working will also require clearer rulesbetter trainingand a new literacy for both managers and staff Rethinking offices as spaces for community eventsWith fewer staff in the officesome publishers have been looking to reuse space to engage audiencesExpect to see more attempts to mix the intimacy of a live event with engaging a larger crowd onlineUK slow news start up Tortoise Mediawhose business model is underpinned by eventshas worked hard to improve its hybrid events over the last yearusing interactive elements to keep remote audiences engaged and increasing the sophistication of its production The Tortoise Media studio space has been remodelled to accommodate hybridThink Inswith prominent big screensmultiple camerasand better soundGreater focus on mental healthWhile home working has been a boon for manyothers have found the experience extremely challengingTo help counter isolationUK regional publisher Reach has organised online book and film clubsand social cook alongsStaff also get a free subscription to a mindfulness app (Headspace)an online wellness hubas well as access to psychological counselling if neededExpect to see other publishers to adopt these approaches in 2022 and provide extra training for managers on how to support staff effectively 3 2 New approaches to the newsgreater diversityless confrontationIt s not only journalists who have been feeling the pressureOur own research at the Reuters Institute consistently finds that audiences often feel overwhelmed by the amount of newswith many saying they regularly avoid the news because it is too depressingThese trends have been compounded by the relentlessly negative nature of the news over the last year about COVID 19 and climate change At the same time the pandemic has forced many newsrooms to reassess their editorial approachRemote working is breaking down hierarchies and a new wave of editors are embracing a more positive and diverse agendaIn 2021partly in response to the gender and racial reckonings of the last few yearsa number of the most prized roles in US media were filled by female journalistsmany of them women of colour What can we expect this year Diversity progress shift reaches beyond United StatesThe lack of diversity and lack of equity in journalism are well documented and won t be solved this yearbut more publishers are now openly acknowledging the damage this has done in terms of public trust and audience attentionAnnouncing the appointment of Washington Post s first female Executive EditorSally Buzbeepublisher Fred Ryan made clear they were looking for a leader who wouldprioritise diversity and inclusion in our news coverage as well as our hiring and promotion A recent Reuters Institute factsheet highlights how progress is still unevenly distributedAcross 12 strategic marketsless than a quarter (22 ) of top editors are womenbut this ranges from 60in South Africa to 0in JapanDespite thisour recent Changing Newsrooms survey found that most publishers feel they are doing a good job in addressing gender diversity but have more work to do elsewhereEthnic diversity remains the biggest priority (35 ) for media companies this year in terms of improving newsroom diversityOutside the US we can expect much more focus on recruitment of journalists from minority groups this year as well as the way they are portrayed in the mediaGreater diversity may also become more of a business imperative this yearwith younger readers in particular paying close attention to content that speaks to or serves their identity Constructive formatsA more diverse set of editors is also questioning traditional assumptions about how to cover the newsMany are looking for alternatives to confrontational talk shows and divisive columnistsSwedish TV national editors are now required to include one constructive item a day in their main nightly show and local teams have targets around in depth coverage Research suggests these solution orientated formats appeal more to younger audiences and that people feel better informed and more empowered after watching or reading constructive storiesMeanwhile the Constructive Journalism Institute in Denmark has been pioneering formats such asSolved or Squeezedin conjunction with a local TV stationwhere politicians from different political parties are challenged to come up with solutions to a specific problem as their physical space gets more restricted over a 20 minute periodFollowing positive feedback from politicians and audiences they plan to iterate and repeat the format this year TV2 Fyn Solved or SqueezedPoliticians are squeezed until they agreeElsewhere a TV station has experimented with putting politicians in the audience to listen to the views of ordinary people and in similar vein the Guardian has introduced a format where people with different perspectives come together over a meal to find common ground Explanatory formats become viral hitThe increased complexity of stories such as COVID 19 has led to a renewed interest in explanatoryoften data richonline formatsAt the BBCpresenter Ros Atkins has been encouraged to further develop a style of no nonsense analysis of complex events boiled down into fiveto ten minute monologues aimed at digital audiencesThese are heavy on factsbeautifully producedbut delivered in a deadpan and impartial wayRecent videos about Boris Johnson s Christmas party woes attracted 11 million views in just a few days a far bigger audience than could have been achieved on TV aloneAssertive impartialitya viral hit for the BBCOpinion led GB News struggles for audienceBut in 2022 these fact based formats will face a further challenge from opinionated hot takes also eyeing social media attentionGB News suffered a disastrous launch and torrid first yearat various stages receiving official TV ratings of zero viewersbut often boasting about its impact on social mediaRupert Murdoch s Talk TV is waiting in the wings and is likely to stretch impartiality rules to the limit in the UKMeanwhile in the USwith mid term elections due and a new social network from Donald Trump on the waythe battle of facts vs opinion will continue to play out this year in unpredictable ways 3 3 Journalistsharassmentand the role of social mediaThe awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to two fearless journalistsMaria Ressa from the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov from Russiahas highlighted the political and physical harassment faced by reporters around the worldMuch of this is driven by political polarisationbut in some countries it has been further exacerbated by the way that social media have been weaponisedA recent report by the International Center for Journalists documented the extent of the harassment of Maria Ressa and her colleagues in the Philippineswhile an accompanying survey of 900 women journalists found that nearly three quarters had experienced online abuse Elsewhere anti vax protesters have also turned their anger on journalistsIn the Netherlands several journalists were physically attacked in a context of growing hostility towards the pressThe Head of News at public broadcaster NOSMarcel Gelauffsays his journalists are facingpolarisation in societyaggressionharassmentand ongoing accusations of fake newsIn the UK BBC reporter Nicholas Watt was hounded through the streets of London by a group of anti lockdown protestorswith footage shown live on YouTubeIn Los Angeles volatile protests over trans rights and opposition to masks and vaccines led to at least seven journalists being assaulted over the summer What can we expect this year Publishers step up supportThis year we ll see publishers providing more support for journalistsincluding security protection for TV crews and better trainingThe UK s largest regional publisherReachis appointing its first online safety editor to tackleendemic abuse and harassment of its journalists head onand we can expect others to do the sameMore widelythe EU says it will bring forward a media freedom act in 2022 to safeguard independenceafter a number of recent murders of investigative journalists allied to concerns about the capture or suppression of independent media in member states like Hungary and Poland New rules for social mediaPolarised debates in social media are also making publishers rethink the ways in which journalists should engage in networks like Facebook and TwitterAfter concerns about reputational damagemany news organisations have been tightening their social media rulesThe BBC s new guidelinesfor exampleinclude a ban onvirtue signallingwith staff warned that adding emojis to social media posts can be enough to count as sharing a personal opinion on an issueOther news organisations are encouraging journalists to avoid getting sucked into time consuming arguments on Twitter In our survey we find most senior managers (57 ) feel that journalists should stick to reporting the news when using social networks like Twitter and Facebook but almost four in ten (38 ) feel that they should be able to express their personal opinions openlyTo some extent these scores reflect the different traditions in journalismwith public broadcasters concerned that the informal nature of social media communication is undermining trustwhile publications with apoint of vieware keen to encourage commentators to express their opinions freely The social media presence of journalists is increasingly difficult to navigateOn the one handpublishers profit from the strong personal brands of some of their correspondentson the othermany require news staff to be neutral or objectiveespecially on political and controversial topicsThis balance is increasingly hard to achieve in politically and culturally charged settings like social media 3 4 The challenge of reporting climate changeBuilding on the experience of reporting on COVIDthe news industry will turn its attention to the complexities of covering climate change this yearDespite mounting scientific evidence that the world is close to a tipping point from which it may never recoverpublishers say it is hard to engage audience interest and this in turn makes it difficult to make the case for further investmentThe World Health Organisation says that climate change is thesingle biggest health threat facing humanitybut only around a third (34 ) of publishers think that news coverage is good enoughwith a further third (29 ) saying it is poorNews organisations have a higher opinion of their own reporting (65 ) but this gap suggests that there is more collective work to be done both to raise awareness in general and to make the story relevant to all audiences Our survey respondents highlighted six key barriers to better coverage The slow nature of developments makes it a poor fit with a fast paced news cycle Audiences are put off by the depressing outlookleading to feelings of powerlessness There is a lack of money to hire specialist journalists who can explain the science Original coverage is expensive as it often involves travel to far off places The story is very complex (CO2 emissionsbiodiversityetc ) with no easy solutions Pressure exerted from owners and advertisersnot yet aligned with required changes What can we expect this year Building more scientific expertise in newsroomsVincent GiretExecutive News Editor at Radio Franceargues that there is a fundamentalweakness of scientific culture and background of our newsrooms and our way to select and hire young journalists is too focused on classical and literary backgroundsHe calls for stronger relationships with academic institutions to help build that understandingReuters Global News Editor Jane Barrett also makes the case for expertise It is too easy for generalist reporters or editors to come to the beat and take every top line as a news story without truly understanding the science and how it fits into the broader pictureOthers say that the key is to integrate expertise more widely throughout the newsroom We need to stop being hesitant about calling it the single biggest challenge in the next ten years and to start covering climate change in every single beat from economy to politics and societyargues Natalia Viana RodriguesExecutive Director at the Agência Pública in Brazil Constructive and accessible coverageOthers will be trying to move coverage away from a catastrophic narrative There is plenty of reportingbut most of it is dystopiansays Götz HamannHead of Digital Editions at Die ZeitThe paper has developed a section called Green which tries to find newmore constructive perspectives on climate reportingFor exampleit only features interviews about the difference companies are making todayrather than what they might do in the futureFrancisco BalsemãoCEO of Portuguese publisher Impresaargues thatJournalists need not only to know their facts but to wrap them up in a way that they are appealingExpect to see more effort this year in information graphics and interactive features to engage and involve audiences Constructive stories from Die ZeitGlobal Forest Watch map one output from the Rainforest Investigations NetworkJoint initiatives to tackle climate changeTo address the shortage of budget for original climate reportingsurvey respondents highlight the benefits of working togetherEuropean Perspective facilitates the sharing of original content between participating public broadcastersAutomated translation using AI machine learning tools is making it easier to make use of this shared contentIn the first six months of operation stories generated this waymostly about climate changeCOVID 19and other science subjectsreceived 14 5 million page views in eight different languages Other examples include the Oxford Climate Journalism Network (OCJN)a new programme of collaboration and scholarship from the Reuters Institute and the Rainforest Investigations Network funded by the Pulitzer Centerwhich is using publicly available data to map forest loss and turn these into storiesIt is developing new journalistic skills that mix statistical modellingdataand cartography Impartiality and climate changeOne burning issue for journalists in 2022 will be the extent to which news organisations should actively campaign for greener solutions or just report on themMuch of this debate will push into the language used by news organisations and journalists to discuss the subjectThe Guardian now uses terms likeclimate emergency climate breakdownandglobal heatingto convey greater urgencyExpect more debate on these issues in newsrooms this year as pressure grows from younger journalists who believe their organisations should take a more activist stance 4Government regulationprivacyand the future of platformsFor the last few yearswe have tracked the inevitable march towards greater regulation of giant tech companies as they exert a bigger influence over our livesMuch of the debate around regulation has been driven by the lobbying of vested interests (including the platforms themselves and many traditional media companies)but the argument thatsomething should be donenow appears to be won and we are moving rapidly towards implementation on multiple frontsincluding anti trustprivacysafetyand moreHaving said thatthe impact on consumers is likely to take years to play outwith much potential for unintended consequences Even in the United Statesthe home of many of the biggest tech companiesattitudes have hardened over the past year following the storming of the Capitol and the disruption to US democracywhich has at least partly been attributed to social mediaRevelations in the so called Facebook Papersa treasure trove of internal documents leaked by former product manager Frances Haugenheaped further pressure on Facebooknow renamed Metaby suggestingamongst other thingsthat executives had put profits before efforts to stamp out hate speech and misinformationBut it s not just Facebook itself false information about vaccines spread through YouTubeInstagramWhatsAppand TikTok amongst others has undermined public health campaigns across the worldall increasing demands for action Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies during a Senate Committee on Capitol Hillin WashingtonU SOctober 52021But news media are only part of governmentsinterest in platform powerCOVID has dramatically accelerated digitisation of other aspects of the economy and culture such as shoppingfilmand other forms of entertainmentAnd waiting in the wings for regulators are new challenges around cybercrime and artificial intelligence What can we expect this year Europe leads the way on competition and online harms regulation this yearThe EU s Digital Markets Act (DMA)which looks to curb anti competitive behaviour amongst the biggest playersand the Digital Services Act (DSA)which aims to regulate online content for a much wider set of intermediariesare both set to become law this yearAt the same time the UK government is planning to pass its much delayed Online Safety Bill whichamongst other measuresgives new powers to sanction web platforms who fail to curb illegal (and other harmful) contentwith compliance regulated by the media watchdog OfcomThe problem of defining harmful but not illegal content hasn t gone away and will remain the hardest problem to solve in democracies that also value free speech and diverse expression More copyright payments for newsFor some timepublishers have been looking to extract money from platforms that use or link to their contentIntense lobbying led to the Copyright Directive in Europe and the News Bargaining Code in Australiaas a result of which some big news organisations in France and Australia have received significant sums for licensing contentThis yearpublishers in countries like Italy and Spain are looking to cash in as national interpretations of the EU Directive come into play But critics argue these opaque deals may not be a great model in that they risk entrenching currently dominant platforms and tend to benefit big incumbent players rather than the smaller or local publications that are in most need of supportExpect to hear more sniping from those who feel these deals give an unfair advantage to large legacy publishers with political clout Meanwhile the platformswho launched their own schemes such as Facebook News and Google News Showcase partly as a way of heading off legislationmay review the value of these separate features if they continue to provide little extra value to users Government subsidies for local media may get realWith mounting concern about news deserts in the USthere has been growing bipartisan support for measures that could deliver1 7bn of public subsidy over the next five yearsThis provision is part of the Build Back Better bill that passed the House of Representatives in November 2021 and would offer a payroll tax credit of up to 50for journalists employed by local newspapersdigital only sitesor broadcast outletsProgress is not guaranteed after the bill ran into trouble in the Senatebut if it does eventually succeed it would mark a major change in the US tradition that journalism should remain financially independent of governmentand potentially provide a model for other countries too Neverthelessthe unstable nature of many government coalitions and their often fractious relations with journalists means that helpful policy interventions are unlikely to be a priority in many countries this yearThe potential is clearthere are a number of existing arrangements in place in some countries that demonstrably work and could be adopted elsewhereas shown for example in the report A New Deal for JournalismThe risk is clear toothat subsidies are tilted towards influential incumbents engaged in rent seekingand leave publishers more intertwined with the politicians who control the purse strings In our survey we do see our digital leaders becoming more optimistic about the potential impact of legislation and other interventions over the last few yearsFour in ten (41 ) think policy changes could help journalismcompared with just 18in 2020Around a quarter (24 ) are worried that interventions could make things worse This change in sentiment could reflect a hope that governments are finally prepared to help get a better deal for publishers and clamp down on unreliable and harmful informationbut it may also be recognition for practical help received such as the extension of tax relief on digital subscriptions in many countries Privacy changes come back to bite publishersThree years agothe introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) created a new standard for privacy and data protectionThe law has increased data protection awareness and led to significant changes all over the world but many of these have made it harder to track usersoffer personalised servicesand make money from advertisingGDPR has also done little to reduce consumer confusionadding a multitude of pop up messages and interrupting usersjourney to content Meanwhile browser and operating level changes are gradually killing the lucrative practice of firing third party cookies and other ways to track users across different websites and appsAs one example the release of Apple s iOS15 stops publishers knowing whether an email has been openedGiven that Apple drives much of the email traffic to publishersthis will make it harder to understand the effectiveness of this critical channelGooglewhich owns the most popular web browser Chromehas also pledged to stop support for third party cookies soon and stop other mechanisms like fingerprinting and cache checking As a resultpublishers will focus on building first party data through interactive featureseventsand competitions this yearEmail publishers in particular will look to build feedback loops into their products to help make the internal case for value New privacy protections in Apple products (Dec 2021) a sign of things to comeLooking to the futurestart ups like Bubblr are offering privacy firstdecentralised alternatives to the big platforms that promise to give consumers more control over the advertising they see 5What s nextWhile most publishers are focusing on making the best of the web that exists todaythere will be much excitement and some hype about what comes nextTerms like artificial intelligenceWeb3cryptoNFTsand the metaverse will be heard more and more in the year aheadbut what relevance do they have for journalism 5 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Intelligent AutomationArtificial intelligence technologies such as Machine Learning (ML)Deep Learning (DL)Natural Language Processing (NLP)and Natural Language Generation (NLG) have become more embedded in every aspect of publishersbusinesses over the last few yearsIndeedthese can no longer be regarded asnext generationtechnologies but are fast becoming a core part of a modern news operation at every level from newsgathering and production right through to distribution More than eight in ten (85 ) say that AI will be very or somewhat important this year in delivering better personalisation and content recommendations for consumersA similar proportion (81 ) see AI as important for automating and speeding up newsroom workflowssuch as the tagging of contentassisted subbingand interview transcriptionOthers see AI as playing a key part in helping find or investigate stories using data (70 ) or helping with commercial strategies (69 )for example in identifying and targeting prospective customers most likely to pay for a subscriptionUsing AI to automatically write (40 ) stories so called robo journalism is less of a priority at this stage but is where many of the most future focused publishers are spending their time AI gets increasingly fluentEvery year sees more spectacular progress in the world of Natural Language Processing and GenerationIn 2020 OpenAI came up with its GPT 3 modelwhich learns from existing text and can automatically provide different ways of finishing a sentence (think predictive text but for long form articles)Now Deep Mindwhich is owned by Googlehas come up with an even larger and more powerful one and these probabilistic models are making an impact in the real worldThe ability of AI to writefluent paragraphsis now on show at the Wall Street Journalwhere it is used to write routine stories about the state of the marketsfreeing up journalists to focus on other tasksMeanwhile the BBC is planning to extend its 2019 experiment with election resultswhich allows hundreds of constituency pages to be automatically written and rewritten by computer as the numbers change all in a BBC styleLocal elections in May 2022 will provide the next test of what will become a permanent system that could be adapted to work with many other types of publicly available data from health to sports and business But AI is changing workflows elsewhereThe Boston Globe won an investigative journalism Pulitzer Prize for Blind Spota story about preventable road accidents in the USJournalists used

all of its outputfollowing a successful trial period within its apps What can we expect in AI this year Images and videothe next frontierDALL E is a new AI model from Open AI that automates original image creation from instructions you provide in textThis could open up a range of new possibilitiesfrom simple story illustration to entirely new forms of semi automated visual journalismIn previous predictions reports we ve highlighted AI systems that can deliver automated or rough cut videos based on a text story from companies like Wibbitz and Wochit as well as the automated news anchors from companies like Synthesiawhich continue to become more lifelike each year DALL EAutomatically creating images from textWhy this mattersThe big challenge for many large media companies is serving audiences with very different needs using a monolithic website or appAI offers the possibility of personalising the experience without diluting the integrity of the newsroom agenda by offering different versions of a story long articlesshort articlessummariesimage or video led treatments with much greater efficiency Summarisation and smart brevity in 2022Expect to see more experiments with AI driven formats this year as research shows under served news audiences prefer Increased use of bullet points in news articles Visual stories over text Mixed media story formats popularised by social media Digital born start ups like Axios have pioneered new editorial forms focused onskim and digbehavioursAutomation could go some way to providing similar benefits for general audiencesThe BBC s latest Modus prototype uses two different NLP approaches to generate bullet point led stories and automated captions for images in picture galleries New approach to content managementEnabling this will be a new generation of modular content management systemssuch as Arc from the Washington Post and Optimo from the BBC that do not base authoring around astorybut instead aroundnested blocksthat allow better connections across storiesmaking it easier to reassemble content in potentially limitless ways Other AI trends to watch this yearBridging the AI divideUp until now the best models for Natural Language Processing and Generation have been focused on Englishpartly due to the accessibility of data to feed the modelsThis has been a challenge for less widely spoken languages such as Swedish or even larger ones like Arabic and Spanish where extra training is often needed to get the required qualityBut this year expect to see faster progressPublications like La Nación in Argentina and Inkyfada in Tunisiawhich specialises in investigation and data journalismhave been refining their own models in collaboration with academics Productisation eases take upTools such as Trint for automatic transcriptionPinpoint for investigationsand Echobox for identifying the right content to post in social media at the time right timeare also helping to make it easier for smaller newsrooms to get startedPublishers in Scandinavia and elsewhere have developed newsroom tools that identify the gender balance within output to inform editors how well they are representing target audiencesThe integration of these tools into content systems will make AI far more accessible and useful this year Cooperation and learningProgrammes to share best practice such as the Journalism AI collaboration programme from LSE s Polis and INMA s AI webinars and showcases are also helping spread knowledgeenabling small teams to build confidenceThe Journalism AI network also enables mentoring for those just starting their AI journeys Improving AI reporting literacyAs with climate change reportingthere is a skills gap around understanding and reportingAI is throwing up many issues around algorithmic biasethicsand regulationbut most journalists don t have the necessary expertise to hold the big companies to accountOne example of what skills might be needed comes from The Markup and its Citizen Browser projectwhich involved engaging a paid panel of Facebook users prepared to share the content of their news feedThis required the publication to analyse huge amounts of data to counter Facebook s claim that right wing contentfor examplehas been getting less popular on the platform Holding algorithms to accountThe Markup5 2 The metaverseFacebook changed its name last year to Meta to signal its focus on the metaversewhich Mark Zuckerberg thinks will be the successor to the mobile internetOthers are deeply scepticalnot least because most of the building blocks have still to be put in place and there are so many different visions of what it might be The term metaverse was originally coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science fiction novel Snow CrashToday it broadly describes shared online virtual world environmentsmany of which already exist in some form (e gSecond LifeRoblox) but will gradually become more lifelike through the addition of virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR)Others link cryptocurrencies to the concept because in some types of metaverse users buy and trade digital assets based on blockchain technology Robloxfor examplehas its own virtual currency and has plans to expand from games to other virtual activities such as shoppingOthers are focusing on making money from hardwareMeta has a leading position with its Oculus VR headsetsMicrosoft has its mixed reality HoloLens and Apple is expected to unveil its VR and mixed reality headset later in 2022with integration into its existing app ecosystemsAR glasses are set to follow laterWith many big companies jostling for positionone big question is whether there will be one metaverse or manyWe won t get the answer to that this year but questions of cross platform compatibility will become more pressing What may happen this year Reporting of the metaverse will become moremetaExpect to see more interviews done in the metaverse itself as the companies themselves try to sell their vision and journalists tryliterallyto get their heads round the conceptJournalists have been extremely sceptical so farpartly because of the vagueness of the ideas and partly because the charge is being led by those who created Facebook FT interview with Facebook communications chief Nick CleggAvatars will be taking their seats in Microsoft TeamsWorkplace may become core use caseThough gaming has been the starting pointit s likely that mass adoption may also come in the workplace not least because the pandemic has rapidly shifted the focus from physical to remote interactions Just after Facebook rebranded as MetaMicrosoft announced it would be bringing the capabilities of Meshits collaborative virtual platformto Microsoft Teams in 2022This will enable animated 3D avatars and interactions will work with or without a VR headsetOver time Microsoft says that avatars will start to take on more lifelike facial expressions via signals from webcamsFacebook Meta is also focusing on the enterprise spacewith Horizon Workroom linked to its own Oculus VR headsetsAvatars can interact and draw on whiteboards togetherwhile directional audio will increase the sense of presence Sports and news events coverageSome of the most enthusiastic early adopters have been special events producers in television who are always on the lookout for new techniques to enhance coverageBroadcasters are adopting mixed reality studiossuch as Eurosport s Cube that allows hosts to see and interact with content around them and to bring celebrities into the studio space from different locations Olympic presentersdifferent countriessame studioTennis star Karolina Pliskova beams into Eurosport studioAll this will make sports (and news) coverage more engaging this year but potentially also confuse the boundaries between what is real and virtually created BBC animated news screen on Second Life mid 2000sDistribution opportunities for newsIt s still early days but if more time is spent in virtual worldsat least some of it is bound to be spent with newsAlmost 20 years ago the BBC developed a news screen for Second Life and it won t be long before similar experiences become possible in a range of metaverses near youHaving said thatthe challenges of content moderation and oversight that already plague social media could get even worse in spaces powered by VR and ARAn early metaverse demofor examplewas disrupted by a bot spewing misinformation about the dangers of vaccinesExperiences from other nascent virtual worlds also reveal extensive problems with racismhomophobiaand other forms of hate speech 5 3 Web3cryptoand NFTsAs we ve already discussedthe development of the metaverse is closely linked with virtual currencies and the idea that digital objects and experiences can be bought and sold in a safe and secure wayThis shift is sometimes linked to the next stage of the development of the web which has seen control shift from (1) old gatekeepers to (2) tech platforms and intermediaries and now potentially to (3) individual users and creators themselvesThe chart below shows how analyst Benedict Evans describes the possibilities in his annual state of technology presentation Web3A dream of how the next version of the internet might work outOf courseit may not work out this wayIt s hard to see big platforms like Meta building their new systems on a decentralised public blockchain for example and giving away the chance to take their own cutThere is also a problem of trustwith cryptocurrencies still seen in some quarters as little more than a giant Ponzi schemeAt this stage there are still many more questions than answers when it comes to Web3 technologies but we are seeing a few practical examples making waves NFTs (non fungible tokens)NFT became Collins Dictionary s Word of the Year for 2021beating crypto amongst othersThe term describes a unique certificate that can record ownership of any digital item such as an artworka photographor even an original news storyThis is lodged in a decentralised public blockchain which serves as record of ownership It is this supposedly incorruptible proof has opened the way for the unlocking of enormous value from digital artworksone of which was sold for69m in 2021In another examplethe band Kings of Leon generated more than2 0m when it released its new album as a collection of digital NFTswith exclusive artwork and limited edition vinylThis process is a good example of Web3 principles where the creators are able to bypass traditional gatekeepers in selling directly to the public News organisations have been testing the water tooQuartz became the first to sell a news article for a modest1 800 and the New York Times later raised860 000 in a similar way with both organisations donating the money to charityNFTs are often sold with additional benefits in the case of the Times this was an audio message from the host of The Daily podcast and the chance to have the winner s name in the paper What may happen this year Making NFTs more accessibleThis year we can expect to see more uses of NFTs that go beyond art speculationPublishers could start experimenting with monetising archives that mention family membersor coming up with and auctioning unique membership benefitsThat in turn will require a step change in ease of use and ways of accessing the technologySports publishers like Turner are building NFTs into e sports appshoping to get a more general audience engaged with trading digital assets and generating loyalty in the processExpect more controversy too over the environmental impact of NFTs which use the same blockchain technology as energy hungry cryptocurrencies 6ConclusionsThis year s report and survey shows many publishers more determined than ever to refocus their businesses on digitalThe ongoing COVID crisis has refashioned behaviours of both consumers and journalists and even when the crisis finally endswe ll all be spending more time online and less time together physicallyIn that context building digital connection and relationships will be more important than ever Achieving that will require a laser focus on meeting audience needsboth with content that helps users navigate an increasingly uncertain world but also with products that are more convenientmore relevantand built around communities of interestThis is why publishers are focusing innovation around their core services as a priority this yearinvesting in formats like email and audio that are proven to generate loyalty and quality time Many publishers are more confident than they have been for some time about the business sidewith subscription models paying off and online advertising bouncing backbut with print revenues in inexorable structural declineand broadcast revenues often stagnant or decliningless digitally advanced parts of the news media may struggle in the years aheadAt the same time there are worrying trends around falling attention for news and politics in some countries especially at a time of growing extremism and vaccine scepticism With a new generation of editors coming throughwe will see more

provisoirement les restrictions environnementales sur les nouveaux investissements dans l amont pétrolier et le gaz naturel pendant respectivement cinq et dix ansCe plan est présenté comme le seul

soudainement au milieu d une guerre culturelle entre les jeunes de moins de 40 ans et les adultes de plus de 40 ansles jeunes considérant que Facebook représente la génération des méchants \"boomers\" et leurs \"fake news\" et autres entreprises avides Prendre un nouveau nom (Facebook s appelle désormais Meta)adopter une nouvelle image de marque pour séparer et protéger Instagram (son actif le plus précieux actuellement)et créer un nouveau produit répondant aux attentes des jeunes est exactement la même recette que d autres industries problématiques utilisent depuis des annéesMais en 2022les investisseurs vont se rendre compte que Meta est en train de perdre rapidement la jeune génération et donc le potentiel et la rentabilité futurs de l entrepriseDans un geste désespéréMeta tente d acquérir Snapchat ou TikTok tout en injectant des milliards de dollars dans la construction de l inquiétant Metaversedont l objectif est de surveiller les utilisateurs encore plus étroitement et de

nombre d institutions américainesLe président sortant Donald JTrump a d abord refusé de reconnaître sa défaitepuis s est plaint que l élection lui avait été volée une affirmation qui n a jamais été sérieusement contestée devant un tribunalmais qui a suscité une large adhésion parmi sa base électoralemenant à l assaut du Capitoleune scène sans précédent dans l histoire des États Unis Avant celapuis plus tard lors du second tour des élections sénatoriales très disputées en Géorgiedes agents électoraux dévouésdont beaucoup étaient républicainsont fait leur devoir en comptabilisant les résultats officiels tout en risquant leur vie sous les menacesparfois de mortde la part d extrémistesEn 2022les républicains veillent à ce qu aucun de ces fonctionnaires traditionnels tenus au devoir ne se trouve au \"mauvais\" endroittous les postes liés aux élections étant occupés par des partisans fidèles prêts à tout pour faire pencher les résultats en leur faveur Dans la foulée des élections

nouveau Congrès comme prévu le 3 janvier 2023Joe Biden gouverne par décret et la démocratie américaine est en suspenscar même les démocrates s opposent à la Cour suprêmeque Donald Trump a pris grand

président de l époqueMcChesney Martinont mal évalué à quel point ils pouvaient faire fonctionner le marché du travail américain sans attiser l inflationCette erreur a ouvert la voie à des anticipations inflationnistes incontrôlables et à une spirale prix salaires massive au cours de la décennie suivanteL IPC (indice des prix à la consommationNDLR) officiel américain a atteint un pic à 11 8en février 1975Il aura fallu attendre la récession de 1980 82 et ses augmentations brutales des taux directeurs à des niveaux allant jusqu à 20pour que l inflation soit finalement tuée En 2022la Fed et son président Jerome Powell reproduisent la même erreuralors que l économie post Covid et en particulier le marché du travail sont fortement limités par l offrese jouant des modèles traditionnels de la FedJerome Powell pense que des millions d Américains retourneront au travail et occuperont certains des 10 4 millions d emplois à pourvoir à mesure que la Covid 19 s estomperaMais il se trompe lourdementCertains actifs ont pris une retraite anticipée en raison de la crise et ont donc définitivement quitté le marché du travail américainLa Fed de Saint Louis estime que l exode des travailleurs séniors concerne environ 3 millions de personnesD autres ne retourneront pas à des emplois mal payés après avoir perçus de très généreuses indemnités pendant la pandémie et semblent attendre de meilleurs emplois et salaires Ajoutez aux nouvelles revendications des travailleurs les pressions inflationnistes persistantes du côté de la productionla crise énergétique et la pénurie de

retraitesla France a alors une idée lumineuse et lorgne du côté des fonds de pension européensqui représentent un montant considérableElle décide que les retraites de tous les travailleurs de plus de 40 ans doivent allouer une part de plus en plus importante de leurs capitaux en obligations du fonds de réserve à mesure qu ils vieillissentCela permet de nouveaux niveaux de relance budgétaire dans l UEet ce malgré le tour de passe passe consistant à dissimuler le coût de l inflation et les rendements réels négatifs des obligations du fonds de réserve à faible rendementqui ne sont rien d autres

largest hotel companies to even considerand Marriott leaders made clear earlier this year they were playing it safe with the wallet when it came to acquisitionsBut that s not to say there can t be some schmoozing over the dinner table with Expedia to offload Vrbo Company leaders told Skift earlier this year they wouldn t spin off the vacation rental platform just for the sake ofvaluation gamesbut hotel analysts think the industry is fertile for consolidation and the next takeover target doesn t necessarily have to be a traditional hotel company Marriott s Homes Villas platform is

hopefuls make to their own campaignsbut there was little sign that the justices intend to transform the pending case into a broadside at campaign finance lawour Josh Gerstein and Zach Montellaro writeSome conservatives had hoped to use SenTed Cruz s (R Texas) lawsuit over the relatively obscure debt repayment limit as a means to totally eradicate the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001the landmark law better known as McCain Feingold that added significant new guardrails to the nation s campaign finance systemSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell a longtime opponent of the law urged the court to throw out the entirety of BCRA and not just the provisions limiting the post election repayment of loanswith Cruz s lawsuitMcConnell brought one of the earliest challenges to the lawwith the Supreme Court ultimately largely upholding key provisions of it in 2003But the justices almost entirely avoided a discussion about the broader constitutionality of BCRA during Wednesday s arguments on Cruz s caseThe only hint of broader consequences from the case came from Justice Clarence Thomaswho at one point asked if the impact of news outlets crusading for or against candidates might be at least as significant as modest donations to campaignsBut no other justices pursued that line of questioning KNOWING KEVIN MCCARTHY House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy once said that his

and check big techlaying out a plan to rein in giants like Google and Amazon if Republicans regain powerButsome Silicon Valley lobbyists are skeptical that McCarthy would actually enact policies that hurt their companiesAfter allthe California lawmaker spent years distinguishing himself as their top advocate among congressional RepublicansThey say he still maintains that friendliness behind closed doorsHe generally is more measured in private conversations with the companiessaid Katie Harbathwho worked at Facebook for more than a decade after joining as the first Republican employee in the company s WashingtonD CofficeHarbath left Facebook late last yearShe saidoff camera or out of earshotMcCarthy acknowledges that he rails against Big Tech due to pressure from his fellow members But at

2022 Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank youWendelland good morningeveryoneOur growth initiatives are succeedingand we delivered another quarter of excellent year over year growth that capped off a truly exceptional yearFor the full yearsales increased 23and EPS was up 49All of our segments grew with four out of five increasing sales by a double digit percentage It was a strong year even compared to pre pandemic levelsSince 2019we have grown sales by 21and EPS by 18We nearly doubled free cash flow to1 8 billionwhich is a conversion rate of 97for the yearWe achieved double digit ROICand we utilized our strong cash generation to reward shareholders We increased our dividend 9and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5through the resumption of share repurchasesOn so many dimensionswe are feeling greatThat saidas you heard from Wendellour gross margin percentage is not where it should beIn the fourth quartergross margin was 36 5down 180 basis points sequentially As expectedbelow normal auto production and seasonally lower sales in Specialty Materials reduced profitabilityIn additionwe restarted idle polysilicon capacity to support Hemlock s new long term solar contractsthus incurring temporary start up costsWe expect to expand gross margin percent throughout the yearWe negotiated pricing increases in long term customer contracts to more appropriately share the higher costs that we are experiencing These increases take effect and accelerate throughout the yearAs alwayswe expect to deliver on a robust cost reduction programThe combined benefits of these efforts should offset the cumulative inflation we experienced over the last year and what we anticipate for 2022Our gross and operating margins will also benefit from growing volume Our operating leverage is such that additional volume drives good incremental profitability and becomes even more apparent as we offset inflationWe expect volume increases throughout the yearAs our volumes increase and our pricing actions take effectour gross margin percent will growAs a reminderthe first quarter is usually our lowest volume quarter of the year We expect Specialty Materials to improve on its normal cyclewith Q1 typically being the lowest quarter of the yearEnvironmental Technologies sales will improve with the resolution of the chip shortagewhich we expect to happen later in the yearAnd Optical Communications will grow as we fill the capacity that we re adding to meet growing demandFor the yearwe expect price increasescost reductionsand volume growth Putting this all togetherwe expect Q1 to be the lowest gross margin percent quarter every year and for gross margin to grow from thereNowlet s take a closer look at

headwinds related to materials and logisticsWe re entering 2022 with a sales run rate 25higher than where we started in 2021and we have a strong order bookWe continue to see significant public and private investments in fiber infrastructure as operators worked to expand capacitycapabilityand access And we expect a largemultiyear wave of growthIn factwe believe private carrier and public

panel makersOur fourth quarter performance and first quarter outlook reaffirm our expectationsWe continue to expect that glass at retail will grow in 2022 by high single digits driven by TV unit and screen size growthWe expect display glass pricing to be flat sequentially in the first quarter and supply demand balance for display glass to be tight We expect glass supply demand to remain tight to balanced in 2022 and the pricing environment to remain favorableOverallwe are very pleased with Display s performance in 2021and we feel good about our outlook for 2022We re operating from a position

was54 milliondown 10sequentially and 42year over year on lower sales volumeThese declines were driven by auto production constraints created by the semiconductor chip shortage that began in the second quarter of last yearAs expectedthis negatively impacted profitability for the segment and the companyNoweven with this temporary setback caused by the chip shortagefor the full yearwe were able to deliver double digit sales growthenabled by our content driven growth strategy Full year sales were nearly1 6 billionup 16year over yearprimarily driven by strength in heavy duty diesel and greater adoption of gas particulate filtersFor the full yearnet income was269 millionup 37year over yearAs we look aheadwe re confident that our content driven approach will continue to drive outperformanceAnd when the automotive market rebounds with the resolution of the chip shortagewe expect significant growth from current levels Turning to Specialty MaterialsSales were518 milliondown 7sequentially on normal seasonalitySales were down 5year over year versus a strong Q4 in 2020 following the launch of Ceramic ShieldFourth quarter net income was92 milliondown sequentially and year over yeardriven by the lower sales volume Full year sales were up 7and exceeded2 billion driven by continued strong sales of premium cover materialsDemand also remained strong for advanced optics content used in semiconductor manufacturing as the broader end market continues to experience robust growthDespite sales being upfull year net income was down as we invested strongly in new innovations that will be commercialized in the coming yearWe have grown sales every year since 2016 through our More Corning approach despite smartphone unit sales maturing Over that five year periodwe ve added nearly900 million in sales on a base of1 1 billionLooking aheadin 2022we expect sales to grow faster than our underlying markets driven by continuing adoption of our innovations and growth in advanced opticsspecifically in products for EUV lithographyAnd as I mentioned earlierwe expect sales to increase from the seasonal low levels we expect in the first quarterAnd finallyturning to Life Scienceswe had a great year with total sales topping1 2 billionup 24year over year Fourth quarter sales were317 millionup 16year over yearThis strong performance was driven by ongoing demand to support the global pandemic responsecontinued recovery in academic and pharmaceutical research labsand strong demand for bioproduction vessels and diagnostic related consumablesFull year net income was194 millionup 40Fourth quarter net income was49 millionup 17year over year Looking ahead to 2022we expect our strong growth to continue driven by COVID 19 vaccine rolloutsstrong research fundinglab utilization returning to pre pandemic levelsand growth in the bioproduction segmentI also want to spend a minute on our other segmentAs a reminderthe majority of sales in our other segment are in Hemlock Semiconductor GroupDuring the yearHemlock saw new demand for solar grade polysilicon With the increased activity and interest in U S based solar manufacturingcustomers have turned to Hemlocka leader in polysilicon manufacturingSoin addition to selling polysilicon for use in semiconductorsHemlock was able to sell solar polysilicon from inventoryGoing forwardsolar remains a strong revenue opportunity for HemlockIn the fourth quarterwe signed long term take or pay supply contracts with customer deposits that start to shift in 2022 As a resultwe restarted idle capacity with minimal capital investment to meet this demandAs I mentioned earliergross margins were impacted in the fourth quarter as we incurred temporary costs to restart solar polysilicon capacityThis will improve throughout the year as solar production increasesAdditionallyour auto glass and pharmaceutical packaging emerging businesses are also in the other segmentand both businesses significantly grew sales during the year as well Stepping backwe made strong progress across all of our businesses in 2021We entered new product categoriesannounced collaboration with key industry leadersand contributed to significant industry advancementsWe re building a strong foundation for future growthThiscombined with our consistent focus on innovation and deep commitment to RD Eis what continues to fuel and sustain Corning s leadership position across its markets Looking aheadwe expect Corning sales and EPS to grow year over year in the first quarterWe expect sales to be in the range of3 5 billion to3 7 billion and EPS in the range of0 48 to0 53Sales are down sequentially due to typical seasonal volume declinesFor the full yearwe expect sales of approximately15 billion and profit to grow faster than sales Before I turn things over to EdI d like to take a moment to express my gratitudeFirstto all Corning employees whose dedication and commitment to this great company is such an inspirationSecondto

customersand extending our leadership positionBased on the growth drivers and financial priorities you ve heard this morningI feel good about delivering on our expectation to grow sales to15 billion in 2022 with EPS growing even fasterI look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the yearAnd with thatI ll turn it back over to Ann for Q A Ann Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsThanksEdOKShannonwe are ready for the first questionAnd I ask thatfolksplease try to keep it to one questionso we can get to as many as we can Questions Answers OperatorThank you Operator instructionsOur first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of AmericaYour line is open Wamsi Mohan Bank of America Merrill Lynch AnalystYesThank youWhen you look at your comments on long term contracts where you re negotiating pricingcan you give us some sense of what percent of your revenue is tied into these contractsAnd how should investors think about the bridge to15 billion in revenuesHow much of that increase would you say is pricing versus content versus market growthThank youAndTonythanks for all you ve done for Corning It s been a pleasure working with you Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank youWamsiAppreciate it Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSolet s deal with the pricing question firstSofirstlet s pull out Display for a momentWe provide glass pricing guidance each and every quarter in DisplayAnd you know that we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable And you just received both what happened in Quarter 4which was flat sequential pricing in Displayand our guide for a flat sequential pricing in Quarter 1 as wellAs you look at let s take now take all of our other segmentsoptoLife Sciencesautoand MCEIf we take them as a wholewe expect price to be up in total dollars year over yearNow each of the businesses is different There s different types of contractsAnd then within each of thoseyou have different customers and different positionsSoit s hard to reach a general statementBut I think as you think about it analyticallybasically we expect prices as a whole in those segments to go up Turning to the15 billionLike always for usthat you should be thinking about it primarily as being driven by our growthThe way the sort of construct that you heard from Tony is that if we look back at this past yearour we had cost inflation much higher than a normal year of increasing input costAnd the way we re looking at the pricing is that of we expect to share that more appropriately with our customers And the pricetogether with our normal robust cost reductionwill put us in a position to offset the inflation we ve already experiencedas well as what we anticipate for 2022That then allows the volume growth to drop to the gross margin line with our normal sort of robustness and without any sort of friction costs driven by excess inflationSothat s the way we tend to think about the15 billionThat s the way we think about pricecostand then how it turns into gross margin percentage gains as volume grows and the price actions take effect Wamsi Mohan Bank of America Merrill Lynch AnalystThanksWendell Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question OperatorOur next questionfrom Tim Long with BarclaysYour line is open Tim Long Barclays AnalystThank youI wanted to ask on the optical comms businessObviouslypretty strong in the quarterCan you talk a little bit have you already started to see the benefits from the renewed agreement with AT TAnd looking out at this businessit sounds like you think you can see double digit growth in the next several years Socould you talk a little bit about how you see the margin progression over timeDo you think net margins can get back to levels they were a few years ago given higher growth and pricing actions as wellThank you Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYesI think the short answer to that is for surewe think that margins will expand in this business for all the reasons that Wendell just explainedI meanfirstwe are taking pricing actions hereThat s where a lot of our long term supply agreements areand those will roll out through the year And then secondlywhen you combine it with the volume increase that we expectSoyeswe expect our margins to increaseAnd in terms of AT Tobviouslythey re a very important customer for usand we continue to see the benefits from that relationship Tim Long Barclays AnalystOKThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Martin Yang with OppenheimerYour line is open Martin Yang Oppenheimer and Company AnalystHiThank you for taking my questionCan you maybe talk about the cadence for price increase and your associated margin expansion for the majority of this yearAnd is there any one quarter where we should expect most of the pricing impact to be fully accounted for Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYesI meanit s MartinI meanit s clearly going to roll out at different times and different pace by customersWe d expect to see some of it start kicking inin Q1 and then accelerate from thereWhat we d expect to have happen is Q1 being our lowest quarter from a gross margin standpoint And then when you add the sales volume increase that we expectas we described how those dynamics workwe d expect gross margin to expand from there throughout the year Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe way we tend to think about it cycle wise is that first quarter will be the lowest amount of incremental pricethen it builds as the year goes on as more and more of the contracts are and increased pricing go into effect and as it applies to more volume just following our normal sort of seasonal cycle in our businesses Martin Yang Oppenheimer and Company AnalystI guess the what I was trying to get at isare there any potential for the price increase with customersthe effect of that to maybe lingering into 2023 also Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s an excellent questionLike many thingswhen we wrestle with the issue of inflation and we try to figure out how to deal with that problemwe learn things and we develop new toolsI would say that our customers have been very fair with us and there have been very favorable discussionsThere s a good mutual understanding that they re that we rely on each other We re real partnersWe tend not to be transactional with our customersand our customers are transactional with usSothe good news is those long term nature of those relationships mean that each and every time we evolve that relationshipit tends to lastSoI think it all really depends on what happens with inflation going forward The key thematic is that we will own our part with the type of rigorous cost reduction we normally doBut for these excess coststhis excess inflationthey ve agreed to share that in a more appropriate fashion with us Martin Yang Oppenheimer and Company AnalystGot itThat s perfectly clearThank you Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question OperatorOur next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox AdvisorsYour line is open Steven Fox Fox Advisors AnalystThanksGood morningTonycongrats on your retirementand thanks for all your help over the yearsReally appreciate it Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanksSteve Steven Fox Fox Advisors AnalystIn terms of my questionI guess I was wondering if you guys could dig into Specialty Materials a little bit moreIt sounded like there are some new drivers that s going to help sales growth this yearJust trying to understand maybe the new versus the more typical growth of the recent years and then maybe its impact on gross margins for the coming yearThanks Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanksSteveThanks especially for the comments on TonyI think when you think about specialtyyou re just seeing the inverse of what you see this year in terms of marginWe re investing in new programs that are stealth in nature As the spending has gone upthe investment has gone up as we begin to start to ramp some of those production assetsBut they re not totally stable yetand we re continuing to invest in the product technologyAnd what we expect is as we work our way through this yearthose products will get introducedthey ll start generating revenuewe ll get more efficient in making themand thereforethey ll turn into profit year over year profit gains as we work our way through 2022 Steven Fox Fox Advisors AnalystSo more of a second half type of thing you just saidWendell Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYesYesI think more on the second halfwhich is as you knowtends to be relatively typical in mobile consumer electronics Steven Fox Fox Advisors AnalystYesGot itThank you Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsGreatNext question OperatorOur next question comes from John Roberts with UBSYour line is open John Roberts UBS AnalystThanksBest wishes as wellTonyand welcomeEdwardSince we have so much CFO firepower here on this callCorning met the earlier financial goals that were laid outbut they didn t include an ROIC targetAnd if you look at Slide 38 againROIC is only 10 Do you think we ll have a focus on that going forwardYou ve pivoted to focus on gross marginI don t know if you re going to pivot maybe to focus on ROIC as wellAnd maybe wrap the capital spending outlook in with that as well Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSureI meanI think that if you look back over the last several yearsit s actually been a pretty significant improvement in ROICAnd it was clearly one of our focuses both on the original strategy and capital allocation frameworkBut if you go back to what we talked about in 2019it was a very specific commitment to get to at least above 10levelwhich I m really proud of the fact that we accomplished that in 2021especially when you think about the challenges from a pandemic standpoint But for surecontinuing to expand ROICwhich is kind of the ultimate measure of profitabilityis a real focus area for usAnd sothat also remains a high priority from a financial management standpoint Ed Schlesinger Senior Vice President and Corporate ControllerYesI would addJohnthat we expect to growas we ve shared with youand expand our marginsAnd we gave you our capital guidanceSowe certainly are focused on ROIC and expect it to continue to be important for us as we go forward Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question OperatorOur next questionfrom Asiya Merchant with CitiYour line is open Asiya Merchant Citi AnalystGreatThank you for the opportunityAndTonyonce againthank you for all your help Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanksAsiya Asiya Merchant Citi AnalystI had a quick question on marginI meanyou got some pushback this quarterI think Tony mentioned there were some start up costs that impacted margins this quarterwhichas Wendell pointed outwere underwhelming relative to expectationsMy understanding was some of those cost negotiations and inflationary pressures being passed on to customers were being negotiated in 4Q as well Sowhere did you get the most pushback on thatAnd why do you feel so confident that these inflationary pressures should abate in22 with the negotiated contractsThank you Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSoit wasn t so much it s really just a timing questionIt wasn t so much of what goes into effect exactly in Q4who pushed against us and who didn tReallyit s just and these are all long term contract basedAnd the reason we have these long term contracts is that our core value creation comes from us making product and having a high transformation value driven by our factories And the key thing we need to do to drive that ROIC up and to give good streams of earnings to our investors is to make sure we derisk that capital investmentSothe good news with that is that the way inflation works is that tends to put some dampening of the effect of inflation on us because of our fixed cost structure being relatively highBut the downside is with the with those long term contractsyou have to actually sit down and renegotiate themSowhat gives us confidence is we ve renegotiated them and reached a formal agreement with our customers on this is what their pricing will be Soit takes time to do thatto reach agreement and what is the appropriate sharingBut the good news isis once you reach agreementyou have agreement and then now we just executeAnd that s where we areNow we re not closed with everybody There s more to doand that s another reason that some of it builds through the year Asiya Merchant Citi AnalystOKAndJeff Evenson Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy OfficerAnd with regardWendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSorry Jeff Evenson Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy OfficerAnd sorryAsiyaAnd with regard to the start up costs that you mentionedthat was primarily in Hemlockand that s actually a pretty exciting thing for usAs you knowwhen we did the transaction around Hemlock in September of 2020it was primarily based on the semiconductor marketand we looked at solar as an optionThat solar appears to be materializingand we have signed long term contractsand that s where the start up costs came from Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsAll rightNext question OperatorOur next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with J PMorganYour line is open Samik Chatterjee J PMorgan AnalystThanks for taking my questionand congrats to Tony and EdI was going to just ask on Display hereTonyyou sounded optimistic about the retail TV environment in 2022At least in 4Q from the data we sawI meanwe haven t seen any positive data points At least the industry seemed a bit more bearish or had a sort of seeing a soft environment in terms of TV retail in 4QSowhat s really driving in terms of data pointsand maybe what you re looking at driving that optimism about TV unit outlook in 2022And separatelyjust on the screen size as wellI meansome of the recent data show screen size increases aren t going up as much as it used toIs there an inflation driven change in consumer behavior where consumers are maybe pulling back a bit in terms of moving to higher screen sizesThank you Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWellheythanks for the question on DisplayWe think it s really it s an important area because what we have heard from investors is that a key factor weighing on our stock price is a concern that the current cycle of downward price and profits in the LCD panel industry would cause a significant glass price and profit squeeze for CorningNow what we said in Quarter 3 is that we believe glass supply demand balance will be tightAnd thereforethe glass pricing environment will remain favorable And thereforewe did not expect a significant reduction in our profit streamWe now have Quarter 4 dataGlass price was flat sequentiallyFurtherwe guided that for Quarter 1the glass price will be flat sequentially Once againglass supply demand remains tightSonow we have a more confirmatory evidence to support our belief that the pricing environment will be favorable in 2022ThatI thinkis the core evidence that we re looking atNowwhen you shift to thinking about the marketretail so for glass out in retail overall is like in the range of what we anticipatedrightAnd sizewe actually expect to do quite well in the coming year One of the things that happened sort of during the pandemic is that a lot of smaller screens were soldand that tends to be the place where the units we expected to drop off moreAnd they havewhich has sort of has the effect of also acceleratingif anythingthe diagonal growth on averageThat s the way we tend to think about size and retailWould you guys have anything to add on that Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNoI think that s exactly rightI meanour expectations for the year really haven t changedThey re pretty well in line from a unit standpoint with what third party people in the industry are looking atAnd the screen sizewe re very confident in I mean1 5 inch has been pretty consistent for a very long period of timeAnd when you look at the growth above 65 inches TVs over the last yearit just confirms that 1 5 inchWe feel very confident about that Samik Chatterjee J PMorgan AnalystThank you Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question OperatorOur next question comes from George Notter with JefferiesYour line is open George Notter Jefferies AnalystHiguysThanks very muchI guess I wanted to ask about the optical businessObviouslyI think the bet there is just how fast you guys can expand manufacturing capacity I saw you grew that businessobviouslyabout 6 5sequentiallySoyou re making progressBut at the same timewe hear about how your lead times are nearly two years for high count fiber cablesSomaybe you could talk about the gating items to expanding capacity there Is it resinIs it buildings and draw towersJust kind of walk us through what you seeAnd then last thingcongrats to Tony Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanksGeorge Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanksLike as you point outI won t comment on our specific backlog by product lineBut as you point outif we could make morewe could sell moreAnd that s why we announced the capacity expansions that we did last yearand we expect those to ramp as the year goes on With each of those capacity expansionswe need to have in place long term commitments from our customersand we have those and that is rampingSothe real bottleneck isn t resinisn t raw materialsisn t laborIt is just us being able to get into place capacity that is more appropriately balanced to the demand that we are experiencing Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsThanksWendellAll rightNext question OperatorOur next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman SachsYour line is open Rod Hall Goldman Sachs AnalystYesThanks for fitting me inCongratsTonyGreat working with you Best of luck on retirement Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanksRod Rod Hall Goldman Sachs AnalystSoI had two questionsone on HemlockThe Hemlock commentary on solarI thoughtwas pretty positiveDo you have any ideas for growth there in22 on21 mid single digitsAny kind of indication you could give us for that Ed Schlesinger Senior Vice President and Corporate ControllerRodwe re not specifically giving guidancebut what I would say is we ve signed a number of long termmultiyear agreementsWe received cash upfrontThey re take or pay agreementsSowe re highly confident that we ll be able to fill the capacity that we have coming online Soyou ll see that expand through the year in 2022 Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOne of the interesting dynamics that Ann could maybe sit down with you on afterwardsRodis from a modeling standpointWhen we did the Hemlock transactionas you heard from Jeffso we really stood on the semiconductor businessbut we picked up all of those solar capabilities that really is an option with thatwith inventory that we also had that was that is solar gradeAnd sojust through this yearwe sold down a hunk of that inventorywhich generated cash nicelyAnd then now you re really seeing new solar grade polysi being made by us with the start up that you re talking about Sowhen you work through the modelinglet s have Ann sit down to provide a little bit of help on just sort of how that worked Rod Hall Goldman Sachs AnalystOKgreatThanksWendellAnd then the buyback is kind of back to the same level it was in December of 2019Should we be thinking like we re back into kind of a normalized buyback regime now Tony Tripeny Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWellfor sureRodour approach from a buyback standpoint is that firstwe generate very strong operating cash flowAnd our first priority is to invest that in our business and our growth and sustained leadershipAnd then obviouslyonce we ve done thatwe want to return the cash to shareholdersAs Ed mentionedwe ve increased the dividend in 2021and we expect to increase the dividend in 2022 And then we ll be opportunistic on buybacksAnd we saw Q4 as a really great opportunity to buy back shares where the stock price wasand we ll continue to pursue buybacks on an opportunistic basis Rod Hall Goldman Sachs AnalystGreatOKThanks a lotTonyThank you Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsShannonlet s take one more questionplease OperatorOur last questionfrom Meta Marshall with Morgan StanleyYour line is open Meta Marshall Morgan Stanley AnalystGreatThanksMaybe just a question on environmentalI just wanted to get a sense of clearlysupply chain is an issue with autos right nowbut we hear a lot of like cars that are basically ready to go and just need a chip And sojust trying to get a sense of when you would expect to see environmental tick back upIs it when the supply chain shortage kind of alleviates itself on the auto marketOr you would need kind of a quarter or two after that to work through kind of inventory that they may haveThanks Wendell Weeks Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe don t see a significant inventory sort of overhang for our productOne of the reasons is that our demand supply was tight for that product to begin with as we worked our way through the yearand our content strategy has put a good amount of strain on our ability to supplySoin generalif you had a point of view on when chips started to come back for auto and as auto production scalewe would expect to roughly follow that timing Meta Marshall Morgan Stanley AnalystGreatThank you Ann Nicholson Vice President of Investor RelationsGreatThanksMetaAll rightThank you all for joining us today Before we closeI wanted to let everyone know that we will attend the SIG 11th Annual

the worldWe got a similar picture earlier in the year from the most comprehensive book yet on Mark Zuckerberg s out of control company Nowhat really screwed the social media giant was the fact that as Haugen testified before Congressits entire service went down for the better part of a dayThat showed how many millions of people had come to rely on WhatsAppInstagramand the original Facebook servicefor communication and commerceWhich in turn gave governments around the world their clearest signalIf Facebook can t manage itself properlyperhaps it should be broken up or regulated as a public utilityWill all that be enough to rein in one of the few companies to fall victim to bipartisan anger this yearor will its Meta rebranding pull the wool over enough eyesTo find outyou re just

Zwischenwahlen in den USA kommt es bei der Bestätigung der knappen Wahlergebnisse für Senat bzwRepräsentantenhaus zu einer Pattsituationsodass der 118Kongress nicht wie geplant Anfang 2023 seine Arbeit aufnehmen kann Die chaotischen US Präsidentschaftswahlen 2020 erwiesen sich für eine Reihe von US Institutionen als ein Moment des SchreckensAmtsinhaber Donald JTrump weigerte sich zunächstdie Wahlniederlage einzugestehenund behauptetedie Wahl sei ihm gestohlen worden eine Thesedie zu keinem Zeitpunkt ernsthaft vor Gericht zur Debatte standan der Trump Basis aber auf breite Zustimmung stiessDie Rhetorik des Präsidenten ermutigte eine Gruppe von Anhängerndie ernsthaft an Wahlbetrug glaubtenso sehrdass sie am 6Januar 2021 in einem in der USGeschichte beispiellosen Vorfall den Capitol Hill stürmtenumden Betrug zu stoppenund die offizielle Bekanntgabe des Wahlergebnisses zu verhindern Vor diesen Ereignissen und später wiederum bei den heiss umkämpften Stichwahlen in Georgia für die letzten Sitze im Senat leisteten couragierte Wahlhelfer viele von ihnen Republikaner ihre Pflichtum die rechtmässigen Ergebnisse zu ermittelnViele von ihnen wurden von Extremisten bedroht in manchen Fällen sogar mit dem Tod2022 sorgen die Republikaner dafürdass keine solchen pflichtbewussten Amtsträger an derfalschenStelle sitzen und dass alle wahlrelevanten Positionen von linientreuen Parteigängern besetzt sinddie alles zu tun bereit sindum die Ergebnisse und somit das Wählervotum zu verdrehen Nach den Wahlen im Jahr 2022 ist das Ergebnis bei einigen Sitzen für Senat und Repräsentantenhaus denkbar knappdie Bestätigung der Wahlergebnisse scheitertwodurch der neue Kongress sich nicht wie geplant am 3Januar 2023 konstituieren kannJoe Biden regiert per Dekretdie

Inflation in den USA auf mehr als 15 ZusammenfassungZum vierten Quartal 2022 steigen die Löhne für die untere Hälfte der USEinkommen um annualisierte 15da die Unternehmen händeringend nach motivierten und qualifizierten Arbeitskräften suchenDiese hingegen werden immer wählerischerda es auf allen Qualifikationsstufen reichlich Angebote gibt Im Februar 1975 erreichte der Anstieg des offiziellen Verbraucherpreisindex in den USA mit 11 8seinen HöchststandErst die Rezession von 1980 82 und die brutale Anhebung der Leitzinsen auf bis zu 20würgten die Inflation endgültig ab Im Jahr 2022 begehen die US Notenbank Fed und ihr Vorsitzender Jerome Powell den Fehler aus den Siebzigern noch einmalda die Wirtschaft und insbesondere der Arbeitsmarkt in Zeiten der Corona Pandemie unter starken Angebotsbeschränkungen leidenwas die gängigen Ansätze der Fed zu Mustern ohne Wert werden lässtPowell glaubtdass sobald die Corona Pandemie abklingt Millionen von Amerikanern zur Arbeit zurückkehren und einen Teil der 10 4 Millionen offenen Stellen besetzen werdenAber da befindet er sich auf dem HolzwegNicht wenige sind aufgrund der Krise vorzeitig in den Ruhestand getreten und haben sich aus der Arbeitswelt endgültig verabschiedet Der grosse Unterschied zu früher besteht darindass die Pandemie unter den Arbeitnehmern ein grosses Erwachen ausgelöst hatÜber alle Sektoren und Einkommensklassen hinweg stellen sie festdass sie heute mehr Möglichkeiten haben denn jeSie fordern bessere Arbeitsbedingungenhöhere Löhnemehr Flexibilität und mehr Sinn in ihrer TätigkeitZusammen mit dem anhaltenden Inflationsdruck durch die Produktionsseite und die Energiekrise führt dieser Arbeitskräftemangel im vierten Quartal zu einem noch nie dagewesenen Lohnanstieg auf breiter Basisder annualisiert im zweistelligen Bereich liegt Infolgedessen steigt die US Inflation kurz vor Jahresbeginn 2023 zum ersten Mal seit dem Zweiten Weltkrieg auf einen annualisierten Wert von mehr als 15Dies veranlasst die Fed im verzweifelten Bemühendie Inflation noch einzudämmenzu einer Straffung der GeldpolitikAber dieser Schritt kommt zu spät und fällt zu mickrig ausDie Notenbank hat deutlich an Glaubwürdigkeit

verteidigenlanciert die EU einen ambitionierten Superfonds mit einem Volumen von 3 Billionen Dollarder nicht durch neue Steuernsondern durch Rentenbeiträge finanziert werden soll Der Schutzschirmden die USA während des Kalten Krieges über Europa und danach über weite Teile Osteuropas spanntenwird zusehends löchriger und droht in den kommenden Jahren völlig zusammenzubrechenGrund dafür istdass die

Italien abwehren willeine Vision für einenEU Superfondsvorder die drei Prioritäten VerteidigungKlima unddamit verbundenEnergiewende angehen soll Angesichts der alternden Bevölkerung und der ohnehin schon hohen Steuerlast in den meisten Ländern der EU ist den politischen Entscheidungsträgern bewusstdass es unmöglich sein wirdden Superfonds durch höhere Einkommenssteuern oder andere gängige Steuerquellen zu finanzierenAls aber die Politik in Frankreich das dortige Rentensystem reformieren willkommt mit Blick auf die enormen Rentenvermögen in Europa eine Idee aufFrankreich beschliesstdass von allen Rentenbeiträgen sämtlicher über 40 Jahre alten Arbeitnehmer mit zunehmendem Alter ein immer grösserer Teil in Superfonds Anleihen fliessen mussDies ermöglicht neue fiskalische Anreize in der EUAuch wenn es ein wenig dem alten Taschenspielertrick ähneltAusgaben mittels Inflation und negativer Realrenditen auf niedrig verzinste Superfonds Anleihen zu versteckenbei denen es sich letztlich um Anleihen der EU handeltfunktioniert das GanzeGleichzeitig kommt die jüngere Generation in den Genuss eines stärkeren Arbeitsmarktes und einer weniger ungerechten Steuerbelastungda das System sich als

herausZusammenfassungIn Anlehnung an die 2020 21 von der sogenannten Reddit Army betriebene Taktikden Kurs ausgewählter Aktien durch einen Hype in die Höhe zu treibenstartet eine Gruppe von Händlerinnen einen koordinierten Angriff auf Unternehmendie in Fragen der Gleichberechtigung hinterher hinkenDies bewirkt bei den Aktien dieser Unternehmen enorme Kursschwankungen Frauen haben lange genug gewartetSie wollen endlich Fortschritt sehenDeshalb entsteht im Jahr 2022 eine massiveüber soziale Medien koordinierte Graswurzelbewegungdie Unternehmen mit entsprechendem Nachholbedarf dazu zwingtgegen unfairesexistischerassistischealtersund behindertendiskriminierende Praktiken vorzugehenObwohl Frauen oft niedrigere Gehälter erhaltenhaben sie eine höhere Sparquote als MännerNun erweisen sich diese Ersparnisse als nützlichFrauen beschliessendie Situation selbst in die Hand zu nehmen und im Rahmen einermetoo Bewegung auf den Finanzmärkten ihren erheblichen Einfluss geltend zu machen Die weibliche Reddit Army geht geschickter vor als die ursprünglicheeher nihilistisch veranlagte Reddit ArmyDie Händlerinnen lösen gemeinsam einen sogenanntenLong Squeezeausindem sie Aktien ausgewählter patriarchalisch geprägter Unternehmen leerverkaufenGleichzeitig lenken sie Gelder in Unternehmenbei denen Frauen im mittleren Management und unter den Führungskräften am stärksten repräsentiert sindAnstatt die Aktion zu verurteilenbegrüssen und unterstützen Politiker weltweit das AnliegenSie verstärken den Druck auf Unternehmendie überholte patriarchalische Einstellungeneine

WirkungDer breite Markt greift das Thema aufsodass die Kurse der angegriffenen Unternehmen drastisch nachgeben und die Firmen gezwungen sindihr Verhalten zu ändernDies markiert den Anfang eines Wegs zu einer Geschlechterparität auf den Märkten 7Indien tritt dem Golf Kooperationsrat als nicht stimmberechtigtes Mitglied beiZusammenfassungAufgrund der gefährlichen Mischung aus neuer deglobalisierender Geopolitik und deutlich höheren Energiepreisen bilden sich in aller Welt neue überraschende Allianzen In einer sich rasch deglobalisierenden Welt müssen Länderdie den Grossteil ihres Energiebedarfs importierenihre strategischen Allianzen zügig neu ausrichtenEine solche Allianz könnte darin bestehendass Indien mit seinem mächtigen Technologiesektor dem Golf Kooperationsrat als nicht stimmberechtigtes Mitglied oder durch Bildung einer Art Freihandelszone beitrittIm Gegenzug für langfristige Importzusagen würde eine solche Allianz die Energiesicherheit Indiens erhöhen Durch interregionale Handelszonen werden Produktion und Investitionenin HeimatnähegesichertFür Indien gewährleistet dies Versorgungssicherheitaus Sicht des Golf Kooperationsrats einen zuverlässigen ZielmarktDie Allianz trägt einerseits dazu beidass die Länder des Kooperationsrats eine Zukunft jenseits von Öl und Gas planen könnenAndererseits kann Indien seine Wirtschaftsentwicklung durch enorme neue Investitionen in die Infrastruktur und die Verbesserung der landwirtschaftlichen Produktivität zusammen mit dem Import fossiler Brennstoffe beschleunigen und so seinen langfristigen Weg in eine postfossile Zukunft ebnen Auswirkungen auf den MarktIn einem insgesamt volatilen Jahr zeigt sich die indische Rupie weitaus widerstandsfähiger als ihre Pendants aus anderen SchwellenmärktenDer

relativ betrachtet stark 8Das Geschäftsmodell von Spotify wird durch eine NFT basierte Plattform für digitale Rechte erschüttertZusammenfassungIn Fragen der Vermarktung sind Musiker durchaus für Neues zu habenbedeutet das bislang übliche Modell im Musikstreaming dochdass 75 95 Prozent der Einnahmen in den Taschen der Labels und Streaming Plattformen landen2022 wird die neue BlockchainTechnologie den Künstlern helfenihren angemessenen Anteil an den Einnahmen zu bekommen Zwar waren die Anfänge von NFT für die Käufer von Vermögenswerten chaotisch und gefährlichdoch sind die Aussichten für die NFT Technologie mittlerweile positivEine NFT basierte Plattform bietet nicht nur eine neue Möglichkeitdas Eigentum an Rechten nachzuweisensondern auch einen Weg zur Weitergabe von Rechten ohne Zwischenhändler dies bedeutet ein vollständig dezentrales Systemdas ohne zentrale Plattform auskommt Als Nächstes könnten NFT den Kreativen in der Musikindustrie einen überzeugenden Anwendungsfall bietenschliesslich fühlen sich die Musiker durch die Modelle zur Verteilung der Einnahmen auf derzeit angesagten Streaming Plattformen wie Spotify und Apple Music über den Tisch gezogenBei diesen Modellen orientieren sich die von den einzelnen Abonnenten gezahlten Gebühren nicht an der Musikdie sie hörenVielmehr werden alle Einnahmen aus Abonnementgebühren gebündelt und entsprechend dem Anteil jedes Künstlers an den Gesamtstreams verteiltDabei behalten die Plattformen ein sehr grosses Stück vom Kuchenzusammen mit dem Anteilder an die Labels gehtsind dies rund 75 Prozentwenn nicht sogar mehrder Gesamteinnahmen 2022 setzt sich ein NFT basierter Dienst mit Musik namhafter Stars durch etwa in der Grössenordnung von Künstlern wie Katy PerryThe Chainsmokers und Jason Derulodie vor Kurzem

schätzen die Zukunft von Spotify düster eindie Aktien des Unternehmens geben im Jahr 2022 um 33 Prozent nach 9Neue Hyperschalltechnologie treibt das Wettrüsten im Weltraum und einen neuen Kalten Krieg voranZusammenfassungDie jüngsten Tests mit Hyperschallraketen sorgen für ein wachsendes Gefühl der Unsicherheitschliesslich macht diese Technologie die bislang bekannte konventionelle und sogar nukleare Militärtechnik obsoletIm Jahr 2022 entwickelt sich zwischen den grossen Militärmächten ein massives Wettrüsten im Bereich der Hyperschallwaffenda kein Land den Anschluss verlieren will An den Verteidigungsausgaben im Jahr 2022 lässt sich erkennendass die Hyperschalltechnik und der Weltraum im Mittelpunkt einer neuen Phase der sich an allen Fronten wirtschaftlich und militärisch verschärfenden Rivalität zwischen den USA und China stehenAndere Grossmächte mit fortschrittlicher Militärtechnologie werden ebenfalls in das Rennen einsteigendarunter vermutlich RusslandIndienIsrael und die EU Hyperschallfähige Waffen stellen eine entscheidende Bedrohung für den langjährigen militärstrategischen Status quo darDie Technologie bietet neue asymmetrische Verteidigungsund Angriffsfähigkeitendie die beiden Säulen der Militärstrategie der letzten Jahrzehnte ins Wanken bringenBei der ersten Säule handelt es sich um die konventionellen Angriffsfähigkeiten von Langstreckenbombern sowie der Hochseemarinederen Schiffe ohne aufzutanken in jedem Winkel der Erde eingesetzt werden könnenGegen diese Angriffsfähigkeiten bestehen nun Möglichkeiten zur Abwehr mithilfe von Hyperschallwaffen Die zweite Säule des Kalten Krieges war das atomare Gleichgewicht des SchreckensGemäss diesem Grundsatz war es sinnloseinen Atomkrieg zu beginnensolange der Gegner noch Zeit hatteeinen ebenso zerstörerischen Gegenangriff mit landund U Boot gestützten Interkontinentalraketen zu startenDie Schnelligkeit und Wendigkeit der Hyperschalltechnologie führt jedoch zu der Annahmedass überlegene Verteidigungskapazitäten einen Angriff völlig vereiteln und sogar die Möglichkeit zum Erstschlag bieten könnten Auswirkungen auf den Marktmassiver Mittelzufluss an Unternehmen wie Raytheondie Hyperschalltechnologien mit Einsatzmöglichkeiten im Weltraum entwickelnUnterperformance von Unternehmendie teure konventionelle Militärflugzeuge und Schiffe bauen 10Medizinischer Durchbruch erhöht die durchschnittliche Lebenserwartung um 25 JahreZusammenfassungDer Traum von der ewigen oder zumindest deutlich längeren Jugend scheint wahr zu werdenIm Jahr 2022 eröffnet ein entscheidender Durchbruch in der Biomedizin die Aussichtdas produktive Erwachsenenalter und die durchschnittliche Lebenserwartung um bis zu 25 Jahre zu verlängernwas ethischeökologische und

verlängert somit deren Lebensdauer ebenso wie diejenige des GesamtorganismusDieser Cocktail ist alles andere als preiswertaber wirksam und wurde bereits an Labormäusen mit menschlicher DNA

enormes ethisches und finanzielles DilemmaStellen wir uns vorfast alle Menschen könnten ein Durchschnittsalter von 115 Jahren und mehr bei guter Gesundheit erreichenWas würde das für die privaten und staatlichen Renten bedeutenWäre es überhaupt möglich oder wünschenswertin Rente zu gehenUnd wie sieht es aus mit der Belastung unseres Planetender Milliarden von Menschen mehr ernähren

blotteror notable events (the prime minister s 2019 visit made the front page)When I visited Cut Knife in 2018after my father retired thereI felt that I already knew it through my email subscription to the Courier A forty five minute drive west of the BattlefordsCut Knife is a town of 600 where many of the larger issues Canada faces seem magnifiedretired farmerscommuters from the Alberta oil patchand newcomers from a range of countries share space with as many as five churches and the residents of three reservesCut Knife is politically and demographically dividedand it s trying hard to work on its problems in the midst of economic uncertainty and cultural changePerhaps because of thisthe Courier s most popular feature was a column written by a cat named Tuc( That catmy father once remarked is able to say things about politics and religion that people couldn t )When the paper foldedin September 2020it wasn t a surprise to anyonebut it was a blowThe Courier had often been lauded as a throwback a community newspaper still alive in the age of media contractionRay and Andrea Stewartboth former horse racers and trainers from Albertahad bought the paper in 2016According to Raythe Courier never made any moneyInsteadit had always covered its expenses through a modest grantover 600 print and email subscriptionsand advertisingBut a 60 percent rise in printing costscoupled with a drop in community advertisingbrought it to a close When things got to a point where it was going to start costing us moneyhe says we said NoIt s time What happened to the Courier is an acutely local example of what has happened in communities across Canadaexacerbated by COVID 19According to 2020 researchnearly fifty newspapers and upward of 2 000 journalism jobs were lost in the first six weeks of the pandemic aloneDaniel Bernhardthen executive director of the media advocacy group Friends of Canadian Broadcastingreferred to COVID 19 as the media smass extinctioneventAs a declining number of people get their news from a traditional print newspaperone could argue it was a change whose time had comeHere s a more existential questionWhat s going to replace the CourierIt would be great to point to a hot new digital outlet started by North Battleford millennialsIt s more likely that Cut Knife will join the growing number of Canadian communities without any local news coverageThe town s only media presence is now its new Facebook page The Stewarts say there s no question that the community would have been better served throughout the pandemic if the Courier or something like it were publishing Tuc could have said Go and get your vaccinationsays AndreaMany of this town s older residents don t use social mediawhich is where information about vaccine appointments has often been sharedOthers continue to doubt the safety and efficacy of vaccinationMy father posted a selfie of himself getting a Pfizer shot on Facebook I hope this can show other people it might be OKhe explainedThat s what now counts as journalism if you live in an area without local media coverage Platforms like Google and Facebook have transformed the way we consume and share newsbut the digital revolution hasn t yet revealed an equivalent breakthrough in the way the media makes moneyThis is a paradoxical reality at a time of unprecedented innovationWhat about podcasts and digital start ups and TikTokWhat about the reader funded membership models favoured by independent media websitesAren t subscription based newsletter platforms like Substack the next big thing Articlespanelsand think tank reports on the media s demise abound along with accusations that the media is too richtoo oldand lacking diversityIn an effort to move beyond the grim headlinesI contacted the heads of influential outlets to ask what is succeedingWhat do they know that everyone s overlooking It s time to stop mourning what s been lostI wrote to them What could and should the industry look like in the next five to ten yearsI hoped to put together agood newsreport about the industry s futureWhat I heard back was sobering Friends with jobs infunctioningindustrieslike law and real estateoften ask

industry on which many of this country s best known media brandsincluding CTVGlobaland Postmediawere builtA former women s magazine editor recalls One monthwe had a normal book size 20 or 130 pagesThe next monthour book size was down to eighty pagesThe advertising just dropped overnight Around this timesocial media platforms like Facebook and Twitter encouraged users to share links to articles and videosNews went onlineusually without paywallsThe same tech companies also started to scoop up digital advertising revenue with powerful algorithmsTodaywe take the stickiness of targeted advertising for granted (even if it s a little uncannysearch for men s underpants once and underpants ads will dog you on the web forever)But the ability to track our data is of serious value to advertisersIn CanadaFacebook and Google now receive more than 80 percent of all online advertising The media is also partly to blameIt lost faith in journalism and tried to compete with an internet awash in cat videoslisticlesand misinformationThreatened by social media s ability to glue younger people to their phones as well as competition from online publications like Vice and BuzzFeedtraditional publishers began to post content online without charging for it(The rationale circa 2012 wasdon t get left behindbloggers are stealing your audience and can create content faster than you ) The revenue growth print publishers had been promised never materializedDigital ads the kind you see as website banners garner mere pennies even if thousands of people see themIt s no surprise that many high profile outletslike CTV News and the Toronto Starhave struggled financially(The CBCthe country s largest media outletis effectively publicly fundedand a handful of privately owned outletslike the Globe and Maildon t report their performance publicly ) A small number of independent journalistic nonprofits break evenincluding The Walrus thanks in great part to our donorsI suspect that a larger number of outlets are hovering around the margins of sustainabilitylike a failing restaurant whose owners keep throwing money at ithoping it will turn around one dayAfter alleveryone thinks the food is great Talk to Facebook and Google and they ll tell you that all they did was build a better advertising modelWhy reach only the number of viewers or readers defined by a traditional media outlet s audience when you can run ads targeted to each person on the internetDigital ads reach more relevant customersand they reach many more of themEven if the top four platforms were forced to redirect their digital ad revenue back to traditional mediatheir advertising clients would likely resist The handful of print outlets that have managed to turn a profit through online subscriptions and other revenue like the New York TimesThe New Yorkerand the Washington Post shows thatif you build a product that people value enoughyou don t necessarily need advertising to survivedigital customers will followThe problem for most media outlets in this country and elsewhere is that they aren t the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal brands that draw biginternational audiencesthe Veuve Clicquots and Audis of news gatheringI m aware of no comparable success stories in Canada(While it s unlikely to get many readers outside of QuebecLe Devoir was unique in charging online readers early in the gameand it has maintained stability through a mix of subscriptionsdonationsand traditional ad revenue ) According to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalismonly 13 percent of Canadians pay for online news in the form of subscriptions or paywallsand more than a quarter of those paying subscribers support international publications It s possible to argue that the industry is not

received a lot of attention ideas that recirculated in the wake of the documents whistleblower Frances Haugen releaseddubbed the Facebook Papers the aspect of this discussion most directly related to the media s financial survival is revenueIn 2021Australia passed legislation that would require GAFAs to compensate media outlets when users post links to their content the social media equivalentperhapsof paying someone to reprint an article under copyright law Similar legislation was included in the Liberal government s recent election platformto be completed in its first 100 daysOver the summerthe office of the minister of Canadian heritage solicited input from forty six stakeholders on how the regulation of GAFAs might affect their businesses and which platforms and media organizations should qualify for the regimeIt also sought opinions on two different models for what form said regulation could takeindividual arrangementsbrokered by the governmentto be negotiated on a per outletper platform basisor a standardized contribution from every platformto be allocated to an independent pool and dispensed to outlets in a manner yet to be determined The difficulty of trying to align the needs of organizations and platforms as varied as Bell Mediathe Globe and Mailthe Canadian Association of Black Journalistsand Reddit was encapsulated in the report s findingswhich mentionpolarized responsesto the revenue sharing ideas There is a difference of views in terms of what would be the best modelagreed then minister of Canadian heritage Steven Guilbeault when I asked him about the disparity between different types of media organizations (broadcastprintdigitalthink tanks)old and new platformsand large and small voices Everyone agrees that the status quo is untenablehe maintained Some people would say we prefer a versus bbut everybody says You have to do somethingYou may not end up doing what we would have preferredIt s better than nothing Since the presidency of Donald Trumpit s become common to talk about the relationship between the media and democracy Without a healthy media sectorwe cannot have a healthy democracysaid Guilbeault Whenever authoritarian or dictatorial governments want to take control of a countryto quash opinionthe first thing they go after is mediaWe ve seen it happenThis is what media scholars often call apublic goodproblemIn other wordsthe media is so crucial to the state of democracy that we must protect it even if it isn t economically viableSimilar collective decisions have had to be made in the past with respect to funding for street lighting and public libraries things without whichwe agreeour quality of life would be dimmedThere are challengeshoweverto thinking of media as a utilitylike electricityThe product on offer from power companies the world over is the samebut no one kind of media is like any otherFor the purposes of this debateshould the National ObserverCanadalandand Rebel News be treated the same way Canadiansdespite having grown up with the omniscience of the publicly funded CBCare relatively tetchy about the notion of government intervention in mediaLast Junethe Department of Canadian Heritage tabled Bill C 10proposed legislation aimed at the intellectual property obligations of streaming networks like YouTubeSpotifyand Netflixwhich operate in Canada but are not subject to Canadian content regulationsSparking a challenge from mostly conservative critics about the risks to free speech and the complications of federal meddlingthe bill was struck down in the Senate In July 2021The Logic CEO and editor in chief David Skok wrote an eloquent editorial in response to announcements that Facebook and Google had both signed licensing and or promotion agreements with Canadian publishers which many took to be preemptive contracts in advance of the Liberalsproposed legislation This is not simply private market players paying fair market value in exchange for productshe wrote It s private companies using their trillion dollar market caps and immense bargaining power to steamroll an entire sector in pursuit of their own self interestIn other wordscan we trust the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star which both signed on with Google News Showcasea licensing program that will promote stories to help boost paid subscriptions to cover news of regulation and the GAFAs reliablyWill their deals be sweeter than those of small outlets with less bargaining powerTransparency concerns were also raised about the Australian modelin which the government may have overseen the contracts but the terms of the agreements between media outlets and GAFAs were not made public(To avoid making paymentsFacebook initially declared it would make its services unavailable to Australians )To be honestI m not that worried about objectivity in professional journalismmedia has always been funded by someonewhether a beauty brand or an automaker it just hasn t been the customer(The Walrusnot included in any of the aforementioned dealshas partnered with Facebook to produce The Walrus Talks and other eventsThere is no relationship between Facebook and our editorial content ) My worry is differentIs it enough moneyIf those payments covered 10 to 20 percent of the cost of journalismwhich is analogous to what advertising might bring in for many outlets these daysit s still not a lot to run a company In his 2019 bookThe Tangled GardenRichard Stursbergwho has helped lead Telefilm and English services at the CBCcompared the depth of Canada s investment in news with what we spend on film and television which we fund via tax credits and found it wantingFor yearsthe government has subsidized Canadian cultural products to protect them from the US market s dominanceShould our media receive the same protection from Silicon Valley based tech companies To provide news with the same level of support as entertainmenthe wrote would cost the federal treasury about430 million per year 200 million for the papers 30 million for magazines and200 million for TV newsIn 2018the federal government allotted45 million in tax credits to the news industryNew legislation in June 2021 enablesqualified organizationsto claim up to 25 percent of their labour costs in tax credits currently156 outlets meet the designationStursberg s proposed780 million in tax credits (just over half of the1 5 billion allocated to media in Francewhich has double Canada s population) would be a net increase to news organizations I recently asked Stursberg if his views had changed in light of Canada s movement toward requiring GAFAs to negotiate payments to media outletsand he held true to his thinkinghe prefers the grand gesture Why wouldn t we treat news the same way we treat cooking showshe asked Surely news is as important to usas a countryas drama or kidsshows or comedies Every player in the current ecosystem seems to envision a benign funder somewhere else picking up the tabThese are emergency measuresThis is not a long term planadmitted Guilbeault about his department s recent proposalswhich include a controversial595 million to create jobs at select news organizations (critics alleged that too much went to legacy media outlets within the traditional print news industry)set to end in 2023 I really think we have to figure outtogetherhow to ensure the sustainability and viability of the media sectorWhen Guilbeault was appointed minister of environment and climate change in a cabinet shuffle this past fallhe was replaced by Pablo Rodriguezwho had previously held the role of heritage minister from 2018 to 2019The government s challenge is essentially to solve Canadian journalism s wicked problemDo we save what s being lost or invest in what s new As the editor of one of the country s very few independent nonprofit publicationsmy primary frustration is with the lack of innovation in this countryCanadian journalism schools are pumping thousands of graduates annually into a market with dwindling employment opportunitiesSome of these young journalists launch startups in different regions to bridge the gap between citizen journalistbloggerand corporate mediaBut who is supporting themThere are no government programs designed to further the kinds of small business development from which journalistic innovation is likely to emergeTo be effectivejournalists need infrastructureserver spacewebsite domainssoftware licencescontributor s feesimage rightsa design identityand sometimes lawyer s feesAll that is before they can even pay themselves or anyone else a salary Facebook and Google both offer training and financial support to select media organizationsFacebook s Journalism Project Accelerator Program and Google News Showcase provide fledgling newsrooms with crash courses in membership growth and audience engagement skills crucial to building and retaining readerships(The Walrus was recently accepted into the latest version of one of these programsthe Meta Journalism Project s Canada Reader Revenue Acceleratorto begin in February 2022 ) But their grantswhich can range from50 000 to135000function more like top ups to existing budgets than like investment capitalGone are the venture capitalist investors of the 2010s perhaps because they sense that media s a bad bet Earlier this yearan ambitious new outlet called The Breach was announced with testimonials from public figures like David Suzuki and Naomi KleinThe digital newsroom has better graphic design than most of Canada s legacy outlets and an impressive commitment to publishing newsin depth investigationsvideosand podcastsincludingthe stories the traditional media is afraid to coverBy my estimateproducing a bare bones multiplatformmicro newsroomlike The Breach would cost something like300 000 to500 000 a yearNot many recent graduates have that kind of moneyand not many are in a position to pitch potential investors on a venture thatif it s luckywill probably only break even Because that s where we are atJournalism is an incrementalslow to develop business where success means staying out of debt in an industry where most struggle to do thatIt has always been common for outlets to launch to fanfarerun through their start up fundingand fizzle out before finding a sustainable revenue model(The digital record is no better than print sfrom the Toronto Standardan online newspaper that ran from 2010 to 2015to various divisions of Vice Media ) In recent yearsventure capitalists and private investors have stepped up to take over ailing media outlets only to step away when it became obvious that they were never going to scale up effectivelyIn early 2021HuffPost Canadawhich had operated in English since 2006was abruptly shuttered after being acquired from Verizon Media by BuzzFeed The biggest success stories of the past few yearsthe outlets winning awards for their journalism and drawing in readersare startups with

new classification by the federal government that allows it to issue tax receipts to donors and receive grants from charitable foundations(So farthere are only five such outlets in the country ) But

was almost shockinga subscription only news publication with an annual300 fee (about the same as an annual subscription to the digital Globe and Mail) Canada had not reached the point where paying for news was in the public consciousnesssays Skok of his decision to fully paywall The Logic from the beginning(In 2019The Logic announced1 8 million in subsequent investment from a handful of funders including Postmediaa venture capitalistand unnamed angel investors ) Because of the costmany journalists can t afford to read The Logic s scoopsits audience is made up of the kinds of tech and financial analysts for whom the cost of membership is about the same as a Bay Street lunch A veteran of the Toronto Star and the Boston Globe and a fellow at Harvard University s Nieman Foundation for JournalismSkok keeps in mind that the New York Times took 150 years to become the world s most recognized news brand We want to be the Financial Timesof Canadahe saysFor nowhe s proud of having built The Logic into an outlet people recognize as an authority on business It s not about reaching the most amount of peopleIt s about reaching the right people It would be easy to keep listing independent digital startups in this vein ones to watchthat are making their investors proudBut an industry cannot live by plucky new websites aloneAccording to MediaSmartsa digital media literacy organization43 percent of Canadians ages eighteen to twenty nine get their news from Facebookand the next largest sources are TV (12 percent) and Twitter (10 percent)Most of the population isn t served byor looking forthis kind of media at allThe WalrusiPoliticsNational Observer none of you even show upsays Winseckreferring to the market share information his team collects through the Canadian Media Concentration Report Audience reach is less than 1 percentThis means that a fraction of 1 percent of the population is consuming news from the kind of place you re reading and I m writing for right nowAccrual of readership is like watching the interest grow in your savings accountMost Canadians get their news from big outlets like the CBCPostmediaTorstar (publisher of the Toronto Star)and CTV the same legacy outlets that continue to struggle Realisticallyonly a small percentage of the population is likely to financially support independent journalismNonethelessthat is the model behind Substackone of a handful of newsletter platforms that promises to cut publishers and distributors from traditional journalism by delivering revenue directly to writers in exchange for a cut of their subscription fees Substack doesn t think it s the answer to mainstream media s problems We re not claiming that this model will work for all types of newsand we don t think it should be the only modelsays the platform s statement of purposeSubstackwhich was started in 2017 by a Canadian named Chris Best is not necessarily the sign of a healthy media climatesays Jen Gersonwho turned to the platform a year ago to co found The Linea conservative leaning political newsletterwith journalist Matt Gurney (both have contributed to The Walrus) Because I d heard some Substackers say they found the task of reportingeditingart directionand social media promotion all consuming (gratifying news to anyone running a professional newsroom)I asked Gersonpreviously one of the country s most active freelance journalistshow she was finding the workload If you treat it like a part time jobit worksshe saidThe Line has 8 500 paying and nonpaying subscriberswho receive newsletters three to four times a week We will probably be close to making a full time salary in a year or so(Whichfor a nascent business founded in a dying industrysounds impressive )Most of the people on Substack will reach audiences because they re already successful journalists or brandslast yearSubstack reportedly offered high profile writers250 000 (US) advances to populate the platformTheir success is exhilaratingBut the Substack model faces the same challenges as all journalism everywhereto build a reputation requires timeresourcesand skills inaccessible to most amateursNewsletters also tend to emulate the kind of quippy op ed writing that abounds on the internet alreadyInvestigative journalismon the other handis one of the most trusted and valuable forms of mediabut it s also one of the slowest and most expensive to produce What emerges is that every player in the current ecosystem journalistconsumerplatform seems to envision a benign funder somewhere else picking up the tabNo one has developed a price for journalism that a critical mass of customers is willing to pay Reliable medialike nutritious foodshould not become a luxury productButin some waysit already hasAccording to a 2020 Ipsos report70 percent of Canadiansstronglyormostlyagree that they will consume only news they can access for freeIf trends continuethe future of media will probably be very big and or very nichewell known brands like the Globe and Mail and the CBC on one sidea number of independents or specialized outlets on the otherAt worsthigh quality journalism will be available only to people who can pay for it It s a world where some people subscribe to the New York Times and other members of the Trust Project (a consortium of fact based media organizations to which The Walrus belongs) and others think the cure for COVID 19 is a folk remedy they saw on FacebookWhat may be gone are the TV stationscity newspapersradio stationsand even generalist news websites launched in the internet s first flush those middle tier outlets and the programs whose perspectives are not essential in the age of social mediaaggregatorsand streamingMaybe that s not as big a loss as it once wasOur very idea ofthe mediais changingA lot of the news I read on my iPhone is curated by Apple News editorsIf audiences once treated outlets as authoritieswe now follow news based on its relevance to our interests One of my initial questions was whether the government should invest deeply in the CBC to restaff its bureaus with the reporters and photographers who have been lost to cutsThat would be the quickest wayto my mindto reverse the tide of misinformation and distrust in media across the country and to bring back coverage to communities like Cut KnifeMany people dispute that consolidation at one outlet is the answer even those who might have a vested interest in public broadcasting s successJennifer McGuirewhoafter eleven yearsleft her job as editor in chief of CBC News in 2020just spent a year studying collaborative media models at the University of Oxford s Reuters InstituteShe says media outlets should find more ways of co operating in Canadamajor news organizations already share photography and reporting during the Olympics and electionsOne such programcalled the Local Democracy Reporting Serviceis underway through the BBCwhich hires local reporters to cover stories picked by other journalists and shared on open source networks What s been clear all along is that the media is suffering from a collective action problemeveryone who normally thinks of themselves as rivals should be working togetherButas we turn this thing aroundthe weight of the media s future is significantly being carried by the reportersphotographersand producers who got into the business because they wanted to make a differenceHow insurmountable it feels to ask people to report the biggest issues of our time warracial inequalitydisease at salaries that no longer cover the cost of an apartment in Toronto or leave room for a life outside of workAdd in something like the COVID 19 pandemic and resilience is being pushed to the brinkI can t promise young journalists the career this industry has given me I didn t expect this to be a referendum on my careerbut that s what reporting a story on the future of media turned intoSenior media executives talked to me off the record or on background because they didn t want their personal pessimism attached to their professional titlesEveryone who had left the media altogether said they were so glad to be out of this terrible businessEveryone also urged me to keep going for as long as I can manage It s a vocationsaid Irene Gentleuntil 2021 the editor in chief of the Toronto Star If there are moments where you lose itstruggle with your role in itthat s normalIf you have that sense of vocationyou ll generally come through the other side For those of us who have chosen itthe job at hand is to steer an industry through a transitionone as significant for us as the invention of the automobile in its own dayWe know that the benefits of our work may not be felt for years or generationsMaking Big Tech pay the media for contentas the government hopes to dois only the beginningIt will also take serious policy change and industry collaboration to turn around a situation that s been deteriorating for decades If you step back and look

her trial began in Septemberprosecutors have called dozens of witnessesincluding former board memberslab directorsemployeesinvestorspatients and business partnersThey have revealed the details of falsified documentsoutlandish financial projectionsunrealistic promises and faked demonstrations at TheranosWitnesses often spent hours on the tedious minutiae of financechemistrytechnology and phlebotomy Much of the case against MsHolmes has relied on her emails and text messages to tie her directly to the company s problemsProsecutors must convince the jury that MsHolmes knew about the problems and failed to disclose them to the people pouring money into Theranos and to the patients relying on its blood tests to make medical decisions In her defenseMrHolmes s lawyers tried showing that the witnessesstories were more complicated than they had let onDefense lawyers hit investors for not doing enough research on Theranos before investingAnd they tried blaming lab directors for problems with the accuracy of Theranos s tests Through it allMsHolmes sat up stick straight in her chair and stared straight aheadher expression obscured by a mask After prosecutors rested their case last monthand before calling MsHolmes to the standher lawyers introduced brief testimony from a biotechnology executive who joined Theranos s board of directors after it came under fire from the media and regulators MsHolmes then offered a variety of excuses for Theranos s shortcomingsShe said others had misinterpreted her statements about what Theranos s technology could doShe said thatuntil a 2015 regulatory inspection revealed a host of problems and forced Theranos to void its testsshe believed its tests workedShe said she hadn t been qualified to run a lab and had relied on the statements of others She also admitted to adding the logos of pharmaceutical companies to a series of reportswhich implied the drug makers had endorsed Theranos s technology when they hadn tFor thisshe expressed regret Her direct testimony ended with a bombshell revelation that Ramesh Balwaniher former boyfriendbusiness partner and alleged co conspiratoremotionally and physically abused herThrough tearsshe testified that MrBalwani had controlled every aspect of her life including her schedulediet and presentation and had even forced her to have sex with him against her will On cross examinationshe choked up again when prosecutors had her read text messages with MrBalwani that showed a more affectionate side of their relationshipProsecutors elicited several more mea culpas from MsHolmesincluding regret over how she handled the Journal exposé and a positive Fortune cover story about the company that was later heavily corrected This weekprosecutors homed in on the discrepancies between what MsHolmes said in her testimony and what investors said she had told themNumerous Theranos partners and investors testified that they had believed the company had contracts with the military and deployed its technology in medevacs and on battlefieldsfor example One of the prosecutorsRobert Leachan assistant U Sattorneyasked MsHolmes different versions of the same question repeatedly to hammer the lack of military contractsShe confirmed that Theranos had not had the contracts To show that Theranos was never paid for work with the drug maker GlaxoSmithKlineMrLeach also repeatedly asked MsHolmes about the lack of revenueposing the question for each year from 2007 to 2014MsHolmes said no each time MsHolmes resisted many of MrLeach s lines of questioning by testifying that she didn t recall or didn t knowShe also tried to dispute details in certain questions MsHolmes s lawyers questioned her for a second time Tuesday afternoon with a rapid fire series of statements meant to undermine MrLeach s points and reiterate her initial testimonyOnce againMsHolmes said that MrBalwani had created Theranos s unrealistic financial projections and that Theranos s scientists had put together reports on its technology Until a regulatory inspection revealed deeper problemsshe testifiedshe thought Theranos s lab wasexcellentMsHolmes also repeatedly stressed her concerns over exposing Theranos s trade secrets as an excuse for withholding information from investors and partnerstestifying again that she worried the company would lose its ability to competeDiscussing Theranos s use of third party machines would have violated Theranos s own trade secret policyshe said MrLeach tried knocking down that argument by noting that most of Theranos s investors and partners had signed nondisclosure agreements that MsHolmes expected to be followed He further noted thatdespite MsHolmes s holding a patent for some technologya patent did notnecessarily mean the invention described in the patent worksMrLeach asked her if she had created a pill that measures lipids in bloodas described in one Theranos patent MsHolmes smiledleaned into

clients capitalize on the implementation of the infrastructure bill and largely expect Democrats to resume negotiations on a slimmed down Build Back Better Act in early 2022they were divided over whether such hauls will continue at the same pace with November s midterms loomingI think the frenetic nature and extraordinary investment in Washington will settle back down to a normal level this

facing the marijuana industry and legalization advocates Cannabis policy has never had a rosier outlook on Capitol Hillbutnearly one year into this Congressnot one piece of cannabis legislation has been sent to the president s deskThere is growing fear among advocates that the window to act is closingIndustry lobbyists and legalization advocates say the movement has been stymied by a lack of consensus on the legislative strategyLiberal advocacy groups are pushing for a comprehensive overhaul of federal cannabis policies with the aim of helping people harmed by criminal enforcementwhile industry groups are seeking any piecemeal policy victory that could provide momentum toward more sweeping changesThere are certain people who are willing to forgo any of it if they don t get all of

       "  'cuerpo': 'Over the last several decadesI ve witnessed a lot of change in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer scienceEarly approacheswhich often fell shorteventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successfulFollowing that long arc pattern of progressI think we ll see a number of exciting advances over the next several yearsadvances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever beforeIn this postI ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impactFor eachI ll discuss related research (mostly from 2021) and the directions and progress we ll likely see in the next few years Trend 1More CapableGeneral Purpose ML ModelsResearchers are training largermore capable machine learning models than ever beforeFor examplejust in the last couple of years models in the language domain have grown from billions of parameters trained on tens of billions of tokens of data (e gthe 11B parameter T5 model)to hundreds of billions or trillions of parameters trained on trillions of tokens of data (e gdense models such as OpenAI s 175B parameter GPT 3 model and DeepMind s 280B parameter Gopher modeland sparse models such as Google s 600B parameter GShard model and 1 2T parameter GLaM model)These increases in dataset and model size have led to significant increases in accuracy for a wide variety of language tasksas shown by across the board improvements on standard natural language processing (NLP) benchmark tasks (as predicted by work on neural scaling laws for language models and machine translation models) Many of these advanced models are focused on the single but important modality of written language and have shown state of the art results in language understanding benchmarks and open ended conversational abilitieseven across multiple tasks in a domainThey have also shown exciting capabilities to generalize to new language tasks with relatively little training datain some caseswith few to no training examples for a new taskA couple of examples include improved long form question answeringzero label learning in NLPand our LaMDA modelwhich demonstrates a sophisticated ability to carry on open ended conversations that maintain significant context across multiple turns of dialog A dialog with LaMDA mimicking a Weddell seal with the preset grounding prompt Hi I m a weddell sealDo you have any questions for meThe model largely holds down a dialog in character (Weddell Seal image cropped from Wikimedia CC licensed image )Transformer models are also having a major impact in imagevideoand speech modelsall of which also benefit significantly from scaleas predicted by work on scaling laws for visual transformer modelsTransformers for image recognition and for video classification are achieving state of the art results on many benchmarksand we ve also demonstrated that co training models on both image data and video data can improve performance on video tasks compared with video data aloneWe ve developed sparseaxial attention mechanisms for image and video transformers that use computation more efficientlyfound better ways of tokenizing images for visual transformer modelsand improved our understanding of visual transformer methods by examining how they operate compared with convolutional neural networksCombining transformer models with convolutional operations has shown significant benefits in visual as well as speech recognition tasks The outputs of generative models are also substantially improvingThis is most apparent in generative models for imageswhich have made significant strides over the last few yearsFor examplerecent models have demonstrated the ability to create realistic images given just a category (e g\"irish setter\" or \"streetcar\"if you desire)can \"fill in\" a low resolution image to create a natural looking high resolution counterpart (\"computerenhance \")and can even create natural looking aerial nature scenes of arbitrary lengthAs another exampleimages can be converted to a sequence of discrete tokens that can then be synthesized at high fidelity with an autoregressive generative model Example of a cascade diffusion models that generate novel images from a given category and then use those as the seed to create high resolution examplesthe first model generates a low resolution imageand the rest perform upsampling to the final high resolution image The SR3 super resolution diffusion model takes as input a low resolution imageand builds a corresponding high resolution image from pure noise Because these are powerful capabilities that come with great responsibilitywe carefully vet potential applications of these sorts of models against our AI Principles Beyond advanced single modality modelswe are also starting to see large scale multi modal modelsThese are some of the most advanced models to date because they can accept multiple different input modalities (e glanguageimagesspeechvideo) andin some casesproduce different output modalitiesfor examplegenerating images from descriptive sentences or paragraphsor describing the visual content of images in human languagesThis is an exciting direction because like the real worldsome things are easier to learn in data that is multimodal (e greading about something and seeing a demonstration is more useful than just reading about it)As suchpairing images and text can help with multi lingual retrieval tasksand better understanding of how to pair text and image inputs can yield improved results for image captioning tasksSimilarlyjointly training on visual and textual data can also help improve accuracy and robustness on visual classification taskswhile co training on imagevideoand audio tasks improves generalization performance for all modalitiesThere are also tantalizing hints that natural language can be used as an input for image manipulationtelling robots how to interact with the world and controlling other software systemsportending potential changes to how user interfaces are developedModalities handled by these models will include speechsoundsimagesvideoand languagesand may even extend to structured dataknowledge graphsand time series data Example of a vision based robotic manipulation system that is able to generalize to novel tasksLeftThe robot is performing a task described in natural language to the robot asplace grapes in ceramic bowlwithout the model being trained on that specific taskRightAs on the leftbut with the novel task description ofplace bottle in tray Often these models are trained using self supervised learning approacheswhere the model learns from observations ofrawdata that has not been curated or labelede glanguage models used in GPT 3 and GLaMthe self supervised speech model BigSSLthe visual contrastive learning model SimCLRand the multimodal contrastive model VATTSelf supervised learning allows a large speech recognition model to match the previous Voice Search automatic speech recognition (ASR) benchmark accuracy while using only 3of the annotated training dataThese trends are exciting because they can substantially reduce the effort required to enable ML for a particular taskand because they make it easier (though by no means trivial) to train models on more representative data that better reflects different subpopulationsregionslanguagesor other important dimensions of representation All of these trends are pointing in the direction of training highly capable general purpose models that can handle multiple modalities of data and solve thousands or millions of tasksBy building in sparsityso that the only parts of a model that are activated for a given task are those that have been optimized for itthese multimodal models can be made highly efficientOver the next few yearswe are pursuing this vision in a next generation architecture and umbrella effort called PathwaysWe expect to see substantial progress in this areaas we combine together many ideas that to date have been pursued relatively independently Pathwaysa depiction of a single model we are working towards that can generalize across millions of tasks TopTrend 2Continued Efficiency Improvements for MLImprovements in efficiency arising from advances in computer hardware design as well as ML algorithms and meta learning research are driving greater capabilities in ML modelsMany aspects of the ML pipelinefrom the hardware on which a model is trained and executed to individual components of the ML architecturecan be optimized for efficiency while maintaining or improving on state of the art performance overallEach of these different threads can improve efficiency by a significant multiplicative factorand taken togethercan reduce computational costsincluding CO 2 equivalent emissions (CO2e)by orders of magnitude compared to just a few years agoThis greater efficiency has enabled a number of critical advances that will continue to dramatically improve the efficiency of machine learningenabling largerhigher quality ML models to be developed cost effectively and further democratizing accessI m very excited about these directions of research Continued Improvements in ML Accelerator PerformanceEach generation of ML accelerator improves on previous generationsenabling faster performance per chipand often increasing the scale of the overall systemsLast yearwe announced our TPUv4 systemsthe fourth generation of Google s Tensor Processing Unitwhich demonstrated a 2 7x improvement over comparable TPUv3 results in the MLPerf benchmarksEach TPUv4 chip has2x the peak performance per chip versus the TPUv3 chipand the scale of each TPUv4 pod is 4096 chips (4x that of TPUv3 pods)yielding a performance of approximately 1 1 exaflops per pod (versus100 petaflops per TPUv3 pod)Having pods with larger numbers of chips that are connected together with high speed networks improves efficiency for larger modelsML capabilities on mobile devices are also increasing significantlyThe Pixel 6 phone features a brand new Google Tensor processor that integrates a powerful ML accelerator to better support important on device featuresLeftTPUv4 boardCenterPart of a TPUv4 podRightGoogle Tensor chip found in Pixel 6 phonesOur use of ML to accelerate the design of computer chips of all kinds (more on this below) is also paying dividendsparticularly to produce better ML accelerators Continued Improvements in ML Compilation and Optimization of ML WorkloadsEven when the hardware is unchangedimprovements in compilers and other optimizations in system software for machine learning accelerators can lead to significant improvements in efficiencyFor example A Flexible Approach to Autotuning Multi pass Machine Learning Compilersshows how to use machine learning to perform auto tuning of compilation settings to get across the board performance improvements of 5 15(and sometimes as much as 2 4x improvement) for a suite of ML programs on the same underlying hardwareGSPMD describes an automatic parallelization system based on the XLA compiler that is capable of scaling most deep learning network architectures beyond the memory capacity of an accelerator and has been applied to many large modelssuch as GShard M4LaMDABigSSLViTMetNet 2and GLaMleading to state of the art results across several domainsEnd to end model speedups from using ML based compiler autotuning on 150 ML modelsIncluded are models that achieve improvements of 5or moreBar colors represent relative improvement from optimizing different model components Human Creativity Driven Discovery of More Efficient Model ArchitecturesContinued improvements in model architectures give substantial reductions in the amount of computation needed to achieve a given level of accuracy for many problemsFor examplethe Transformer architecturewhich we developed in 2017was able to improve the state of the art on several NLP and translation benchmarks while simultaneously using 10x to 100x less computation to achieve these results than a variety of other prevalent methodssuch as LSTMs and other recurrent architecturesSimilarlythe Vision Transformer was able to show improved state of the art results on a number of different image classification tasks despite using 4x to 10x less computation than convolutional neural networks Machine Driven Discovery of More Efficient Model ArchitecturesUse of SparsitySparsitywhere a model has a very large capacitybut only some parts of the model are activated for a given taskexample or tokenis another important algorithmic advance that can greatly improve efficiencyIn 2017we introduced the sparsely gated mixture of experts layerwhich demonstrated better results on a variety of translation benchmarks while using 10x less computation than previous state of the art dense LSTM modelsMore recentlySwitch Transformerswhich pair a mixture of experts style architecture with the Transformer model architecturedemonstrated a 7x speedup in training time and efficiency over the dense T5 Base Transformer modelThe GLaM model showed that transformers and mixture of expert style layers can be combined to produce a model that exceeds the accuracy of the GPT 3 model on average across 29 benchmarks using 3x less energy for training and 2x less computation for inferenceThe notion of sparsity can also be applied to reduce the cost of the attention mechanism in the core Transformer architecture The BigBird sparse attention model consists of global tokens that attend to all parts of an input sequencelocal tokensand a set of random tokensTheoreticallythis can be interpreted as adding a few global tokens on a Watts Strogatz graphThe use of sparsity in models is clearly an approach with very high potential payoff in terms of computational efficiencyand we are only scratching the surface in terms of research ideas to be tried in this directionEach of these approaches for improved efficiency can be combined together so that equivalent accuracy language models trained today in efficient data centers are100 times more energy efficient and produce650 times less CO 2 e emissionscompared to a baseline Transformer model trained using P100 GPUs in an average U Sdatacenter using an average U Senergy mixAnd this doesn t even account for Google s carbon neutral100renewable energy offsetsWe ll have a more detailed blog post analyzing the carbon emissions trends of NLP models soon TopTrend 3ML Is Becoming More Personally and Communally BeneficialA host of new experiences are made possible as innovation in ML and silicon hardware (like the Google Tensor processor on the Pixel 6) enable mobile devices to be more capable of continuously and efficiently sensing their surrounding context and environmentThese advances have improved accessibility and ease of usewhile also boosting computational powerwhich is critical for popular features like mobile photographylive translation and moreRemarkablyrecent technological advances also provide users with a more customized experience while strengthening privacy safeguards More people than ever rely on their phone cameras to record their daily lives and for artistic expressionThe clever application of ML to computational photography has continued to advance the capabilities of phone camerasmaking them easier to useimproving performanceand resulting in higher quality imagesAdvancessuch as improved HDRthe ability to take pictures in very low lightbetter handling of portraitsand efforts to make cameras more inclusive so they work for all skin tonesyield better photos that are more true to the photographer s vision and to their subjectsSuch photos can be further improved using the powerful ML based tools now available in Google Photoslike cinematic photosnoise and blur reductionand the Magic Eraser HDRstarts from a burst of full resolution raw imageseach underexposed by the same amount (left)The merged image has reduced noise and increased dynamic rangeleading to a higher quality final result (right) In addition to using their phones for creative expressionmany people rely on them to help communicate with others across languages and modalities in real time using Live Translate in messaging apps and Live Caption for phone callsSpeech recognition accuracy has continued to make substantial improvements thanks to techniques like self supervised learning and noisy student trainingwith marked improvements for accented speechnoisy conditions or environments with overlapping speechand across many languagesBuilding on advances in text to speech synthesispeople can listen to web pages and articles using our Read Aloud technology on a growing number of platformsmaking information more available across barriers of modality and languagesLive speech translations in the Google Translate app have become significantly better by stabilizing the translations that are generated on the flyand high qualityrobust and responsible direct speech to speech translation provides a much better user experience in communicating with people speaking a different languageNew work on combining ML with traditional codec approaches in the Lyra speech codec and the more general SoundStream audio codec enables higher fidelity speechmusicand other sounds to be communicated reliably at much lower bitrate Everyday interactions are becoming much more natural with features like automatic call screening and ML agents that will wait on hold for youthanks to advances in DuplexEven short tasks that users may perform frequently have been improved with tools such as Smart Text Selectionwhich automatically selects entities like phone numbers or addresses for easy copy and pastingand grammar correction as you type on Pixel 6 phonesIn additionScreen Attention prevents the phone screen from dimming when you are looking at it and improvements in gaze recognition are opening up new use cases for accessibility and for improved wellness and healthML is also enabling new methods for ensuring the safety of people and communitiesFor exampleSuspicious Message Alerts warn against possible phishing attacks and Safer Routing detects hard braking events to suggest alternate routes Recent work demonstrates the ability of gaze recognition as an important biomarker of mental fatigue Given the potentially sensitive nature of the data that underlies these new capabilitiesit is essential that they are designed to be private by defaultMany of them run inside of Android s Private Compute Core an open sourcesecure environment isolated from the rest of the operating systemAndroid ensures that data processed in the Private Compute Core is not shared to any apps without the user taking an actionAndroid also prevents any feature inside the Private Compute Core from having direct access to the networkInsteadfeatures communicate over a small set of open source APIs to Private Compute Serviceswhich strips out identifying information and makes use of privacy technologiesincluding federated learningfederated analyticsand private information retrievalenabling learning while simultaneously ensuring privacy Federated Reconstruction is a novel partially local federated learning technique in which models are partitioned into global and local parametersFor each round of Federated Reconstruction training(1) The server sends the current global parameters g to each user i(2) Each user i freezes g and reconstructs their local parameters l i (3) Each user i freezes l i and updates g to produce g i (4) Usersg i are averaged to produce the global parameters for the next round These technologies are critical to evolving next generation computation and interaction paradigmswhereby personal or communal devices can both learn from and contribute to training a collective model of the world without compromising privacyA federated unsupervised approach to privately learn the kinds of aforementioned general purpose models with fine tuning for a given task or context could unlock increasingly intelligent systems that are far more intuitive to interact with more like a social entity than a machineBroad and equitable access to these intelligent interfaces will only be possible with deep changes to our technology stacksfrom the edge to the datacenterso that they properly support neural computing TopTrend 4Growing Impact of ML in ScienceHealth and SustainabilityIn recent yearswe have seen an increasing impact of ML in the basic sciencesfrom physics to biologywith a number of exciting practical applications in related realmssuch as renewable energy and medicineComputer vision models have been deployed to address problems at both personal and global scalesThey can assist physicians in their regular workexpand our understanding of neural physiologyand also provide better weather forecasts and streamline disaster relief effortsOther types of ML models are proving critical in addressing climate change by discovering ways to reduce emissions and improving the output of alternative energy sourcesSuch models can even be leveraged as creative tools for artistsAs ML becomes more robustwell developedand widely accessibleits potential for high impact applications in a broad array of real world domains continues to expandhelping to solve some of our most challenging problems Large Scale Application of Computer Vision for New InsightsAutomated Design Space ExplorationAnother approach that has yielded excellent results across many fields is to allow an ML algorithm to explore and evaluate a problem s design space for possible solutions in an automated wayIn one applicationa Transformer based variational autoencoder learns to create aesthetically pleasing and useful document layoutsand the same approach can be extended to explore possible furniture layoutsAnother ML driven approach automates the exploration of the huge design space of tweaks for computer game rules to improve playability and other attributes of a gameenabling human game designers to create enjoyable games more quicklyA visualization of the Variational Transformer Network (VTN) modelwhich is able to extract meaningful relationships between the layout elements (paragraphstablesimagesetc ) in order to generate realistic synthetic documents (e gwith better alignment and margins)Other ML algorithms have been used to evaluate the design space of computer architectural decisions for ML accelerator chips themselvesWe ve also shown that ML can be used to quickly create chip placements for ASIC designs that are better than layouts generated by human experts and can be generated in a matter of hours instead of weeksThis reduces the fixed engineering costs of chips and lowers the barrier to quickly creating specialized hardware for different applicationsWe ve successfully used this automated placement approach in the design of our upcoming TPU v5 chipSuch exploratory ML approaches have also been applied to materials discoveryIn a collaboration between Google Research and Caltechseveral ML modelscombined with a modified inkjet printer and a custom built microscopewere able to rapidly search over hundreds of thousands of possible materials to hone in on 51 previously uncharacterized three metal oxide materials with promising properties for applications in areas like battery technology and electrolysis of waterThese automated design space exploration approaches can help accelerate many scientific fieldsespecially when the entire experimental loop of generating the experiment and evaluating the result can all be done in an automated or mostly automated mannerI expect to see this approach applied to good effect in many more areas in the coming years Application to HealthML Applications for the Climate CrisisTopTrend 5Deeper and Broader Understanding of MLAs ML is used more broadly across technology products and society more generallyit is imperative that we continue to develop new techniques to ensure that it is applied fairly and equitablyand that it benefits all people and not just select subsetsThis is a major focus for our Responsible AI and Human Centered Technology research group and an area in which we conduct research on a variety of responsibility related topics One area of focus is recommendation systems that are based on user activity in online productsBecause these recommendation systems are often composed of multiple distinct componentsunderstanding their fairness properties often requires insight into individual components as well as how the individual components behave when combined togetherRecent work has helped to better understand these relationshipsrevealing ways to improve the fairness of both individual components and the overall recommendation systemIn additionwhen learning from implicit user activityit is also important for recommendation systems to learn in an unbiased mannersince the straightforward approach of learning from items that were shown to previous users exhibits well known forms of biasWithout correcting for such biasesfor exampleitems that were shown in more prominent positions to users tend to get recommended to future users more often As in recommendation systemssurrounding context is important in machine translationBecause most machine translation systems translate individual sentences in isolationwithout additional surrounding contextthey can often reinforce biases related to genderage or other areasIn an effort to address some of these issueswe have a long standing line of research on reducing gender bias in our translation systemsand to help the entire translation communitylast year we released a dataset to study gender bias in translation based on translations of Wikipedia biographies Another common problem in deploying machine learning models is distributional shiftif the statistical distribution of data on which the model was trained is not the same as that of the data the model is given as inputthe model s behavior can sometimes be unpredictableIn recent workwe employ the Deep Bootstrap framework to compare the real worldwhere there is finite training datato an \"ideal world\"where there is infinite dataBetter understanding of how a model behaves in these two regimes (real vsideal) can help us develop models that generalize better to new settings and exhibit less bias towards fixed training datasets Although work on ML algorithms and model development gets significant attentiondata collection and dataset curation often gets lessBut this is an important areabecause the data on which an ML model is trained can be a potential source of bias and fairness issues in downstream applicationsAnalyzing such data cascades in ML can help identify the many places in the lifecycle of an ML project that can have substantial influence on the outcomesThis research on data cascades has led to evidence backed guidelines for data collection and evaluation in the revised PAIR Guidebookaimed at ML developers and designers Arrows of different color indicate various types of data cascadeseach of which typically originate upstreamcompound over the ML development processand manifest downstream The general goal of better understanding data is an important part of ML researchOne thing that can help is finding and investigating anomalous dataWe have developed methods to better understand the influence that particular training examples can have on an ML modelsince mislabeled data or other similar issues can have outsized impact on the overall model behaviorWe have also built the Know Your Data tool to help ML researchers and practitioners better understand properties of their datasetsand last year we created a case study of how to use the Know Your Data tool to explore issues like gender bias and age bias in a dataset A screenshot from Know Your Data showing the relationship between words that describe attractiveness and gendered wordsFor example attractiveandmale man boyco occur 12 timesbut we expect60 times by chance (the ratio is 0 2x)On the other hand attractiveandfemale woman girlco occur 2 62 times more than chance Understanding dynamics of benchmark dataset usage is also importantgiven the central role they play in the organization of ML as a fieldAlthough studies of individual datasets have become increasingly commonthe dynamics of dataset usage across the field have remained underexploredIn recent workwe published the first large scale empirical analysis of dynamics of dataset creationadoptionand reuseThis work offers insights into pathways to enable more rigorous evaluationsas well as more equitable and socially informed research Creating public datasets that are more inclusive and less biased is an important way to help improve the field of ML for everyoneIn 2016we released the Open Images dataseta collection of9 million images annotated with image labels spanning thousands of object categories and bounding box annotations for 600 classesLast yearwe introduced the More Inclusive Annotations for People (MIAP) dataset in the Open Images Extended collectionThe collection contains more complete bounding box annotations for the person class hierarchyand each annotation is labeled with fairness related attributesincluding perceived gender presentation and perceived age rangeWith the increasing focus on reducing unfair bias as part of responsible AI researchwe hope these annotations will encourage researchers already leveraging the Open Images dataset to incorporate fairness analysis in their research Because we also know that our teams are not the only ones creating datasets that can improve machine learningwe have built Dataset Search to help users discover new and useful datasetswherever they might be on the Web Tackling various forms of abusive behavior onlinesuch as toxic languagehate speechand misinformationis a core priority for GoogleBeing able to detect such forms of abuse reliablyefficientlyand at scale is of critical importance both to ensure that our platforms are safe and also to avoid the risk of reproducing such negative traits through language technologies that learn from online discourse in an unsupervised fashionGoogle has pioneered work in this space through the Perspective API toolbut the nuances involved in detecting toxicity at scale remains a complex problemIn recent workin collaboration with various academic partnerswe introduced a comprehensive taxonomy to reason about the changing landscape of online hate and harassmentWe also investigated how to detect covert forms of toxicitysuch as microaggressionsthat are often ignored in online abuse interventionsstudied how conventional approaches to deal with disagreements in data annotations of such subjective concepts might marginalize minority perspectivesand proposed a new disaggregated modeling approach that uses a multi task framework to tackle this issueFurthermorethrough qualitative research and network level content analysisGoogle s Jigsaw teamin collaboration with researchers at George Washington Universitystudied how hate clusters spread disinformation across social media platforms Another potential concern is that ML language understanding and generation models can sometimes also produce results that are not properly supported by evidenceTo confront this problem in question answeringsummarizationand dialogwe developed a new framework for measuring whether results can be attributed to specific sourcesWe released annotation guidelines and demonstrated that they can be reliably used in evaluating candidate models Interactive analysis and debugging of models remains key to responsible use of MLWe have updated our Language Interpretability Tool with new capabilities and techniques to advance this line of workincluding support for image and tabular dataa variety of features carried over from our previous work on the What If Tooland built in support for fairness analysis through the technique of Testing with Concept Activation VectorsInterpretability and explainability of ML systems more generally is also a key part of our Responsible AI visionin collaboration with DeepMindwe made headway in understanding the acquisition of human chess concepts in the self trained AlphaZero chess system Explore what AlphaZero might have learned about playing chess using this online tool We are also working hard to broaden the perspective of Responsible AI beyond western contextsOur recent research examines how various assumptions of conventional algorithmic fairness frameworks based on Western institutions and infrastructures may fail in non Western contexts and offers a pathway for recontextualizing fairness research in India along several directionsWe are actively conducting survey research across several continents to better understand perceptions of and preferences regarding AIWestern framing of algorithmic fairness research tends to focus on only a handful of attributesthus biases concerning non Western contexts are largely ignored and empirically under studiedTo address this gapin collaboration with the University of Michiganwe developed a weakly supervised method to robustly detect lexical biases in broader geo cultural contexts in NLP models that reflect human judgments of offensive and inoffensive language in those geographic contexts Furthermorewe have explored applications of ML to contexts valued in the Global Southincluding developing a proposal for farmer centered ML researchThrough this workwe hope to encourage the field to be thoughtful about how to bring ML enabled solutions to smallholder farmers in ways that will improve their lives and their communities Involving community stakeholders at all stages of the ML pipeline is key to our efforts to develop and deploy ML responsibly and keep us focused on tackling the problems that matter mostIn this veinwe held a Health Equity Research Summit among external facultynon profit organization leadsgovernment and NGO representativesand other subject matter experts to discuss how to bring more equity into the entire ML ecosystemfrom the way we approach problem solving to how we assess the impact of our efforts Community based research methods have also informed our approach to designing for digital wellbeing and addressing racial equity issues in ML systemsincluding improving our understanding of the experience of Black Americans using ASR systemsWe are also listening to the public more broadly to learn how sociotechnical ML systems could help during major life eventssuch as by supporting family caregiving As ML models become more capable and have impact in many domainsthe protection of the private information used in ML continues to be an important focus for researchAlong these linessome of our recent work addresses privacy in large modelsboth highlighting that training data can sometimes be extracted from large models and pointing to how privacy can be achieved in large modelse gas in differentially private BERTIn addition to the work on federated learning and analyticsmentioned abovewe have also been enhancing our toolbox with other principled and practical ML techniques for ensuring differential privacyfor example private clusteringprivate personalizationprivate matrix completionprivate weighted samplingprivate quantilesprivate robust learning of halfspacesand in generalsample efficient private PAC learningMoreoverwe have been expanding the set of privacy notions that can be tailored to different applications and threat modelsincluding label privacy and user versus item level privacy A visual illustration of the differentially private clustering algorithm TopDatasetsRecognizing the value of open datasets to the general advancement of ML and related fields of researchwe continue to grow our collection of open source datasets and resources and expand our global index of open datasets in Google Dataset SearchThis yearwe have released a number of datasets and tools across a range of research areas Research Community InteractionTo realize our goal for a more robust and comprehensive understanding of ML and related technologieswe actively engage with the broader research communityIn 2021we published over 750 papersnearly 600 of which were presented at leading research conferencesGoogle Research sponsored over 150 conferencesand Google researchers contributed directly by serving on program committees and organizing workshopstutorials and numerous other activities aimed at collectively advancing the fieldTo learn more about our contributions to some of the larger research conferences this yearplease see our recent conference blog postsIn additionwe hosted 19 virtual workshops (like the 2021 Quantum Summer Symposium)which allowed us to further engage with the academic community by generating new ideas and directions for the research field and advancing research initiatives In 2021Google Research also directly supported external research with59M in fundingincluding23M through Research programs to faculty and studentsand20M in university partnerships and outreachThis past yearwe introduced new funding and collaboration programs that support academics all over the world who are doing high impact researchWe funded 86 early career faculty through our Research Scholar Program to support general advancements in scienceand funded 34 faculty through our Award for Inclusion Research Program who are doing research in areas like accessibilityalgorithmic fairnesshigher education and collaborationand participatory MLIn addition to the research we are fundingwe welcomed 85 faculty and post docsgloballythrough our Visiting Researcher programto come to Google and partner with us on exciting ideas and shared research challengesWe also selected a group of 74 incredibly talented PhD student researchers to receive Google PhD Fellowships and mentorship as they conduct their research As part of our ongoing racial equity commitmentsmaking computer science (CS) research more inclusive continues to be a top priority for usIn 2021we continued expanding our efforts to increase the diversity of Ph Dgraduates in computingFor examplethe CS Research Mentorship Program (CSRMP)an initiative by Google Research to support students from historically marginalized groups (HMGs) in computing research pathwaysgraduated 590 mentees83of whom self identified as part of an HMGwho were supported by 194 Google mentors our largest group to dateIn Octoberwe welcomed 35 institutions globally leading the way to engage 3 400students in computing research as part of the 2021 exploreCSR cohortSince 2018this program has provided faculty with fundingcommunityevaluation and connections to Google researchers in order to introduce students from HMGs to the world of CS researchWe are excited to expand this program to more international locations in 2022 We also continued our efforts to fund and partner with organizations to develop and support new pathways and approaches to broadening participation in computing research at scaleFrom working with alliances like the Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institutions (CAHSI) and CMD IT Diversifying LEAdership in the Professoriate (LEAP) Alliance to partnering with university initiatives like UMBC s Meyerhoff ScholarsCornell University s CSMoreNortheastern University s Center for Inclusive Computingand MIT s MEnTorEd Opportunities in Research (METEOR)we are taking a community based approach to materially increase the representation of marginalized groups in computing research Other WorkIn writing these retrospectivesI try to focus on new research work that has happened (mostly) in the past year while also looking aheadIn past yearsretrospectivesI ve tried to be more comprehensivebut this time I thought it could be more interesting to focus on just a few themesWe ve also done great work in many other research areas that don t fit neatly into these themesIf you re interestedI encourage you to check out our research publications by area below or by year (and if you re interested in quantum computingour Quantum team recently wrote a retrospective of their work in 2021) ConclusionResearch is often a multi year journey to real world impactEarly stage research work that happened a few years ago is now having a dramatic impact on Google s products and across the worldInvestments in ML hardware accelerators like TPUs and in software frameworks like TensorFlow and JAX have borne fruitML models are increasingly prevalent in many different products and features at Google because their power and ease of expression streamline experimentation and productionization of ML models in performance critical environmentsResearch into model architectures to create Seq2SeqInceptionEfficientNetand Transformer or algorithmic research like batch normalization and distillation is driving progress in the fields of language understandingvisionspeechand othersBasic capabilities like better language and visual understanding and speech recognition can be transformationaland as a resultthese sorts of models are widely deployed for a wide variety of problems in many of our products including SearchAssistantAdsCloudGmailMapsYouTubeWorkspaceAndroidPixelNestand Translate These are truly exciting times in machine learning and computer scienceContinued improvement in computersability to understand and interact with the world around them through languagevisionand sound opens up entire new frontiers of how computers can help people accomplish things in the worldThe many examples of progress along the five themes outlined in this post are waypoints in a long term journey AcknowledgementsThanks to Alison CarrollAlison LentzAndrew CarrollAndrew TomkinsAvinatan

       "  'cuerpo': 'This year s conference from the Advertising AssociationIPA and ISBA RENEW 2022 was a holistic online event outlining the key themes relevant to the whole of the UK advertising industry at this moment in history Leaders from across the business took to their laptopsring lights on and bookcases backdrop readyto mark where the industry is on a range of subjects right nowand to lay out plans to address the most pressing issues for UK advertising Unsurprisinglymany of the same themes reared their heads repeatedly throughout the eventHereLBB s Alex Reeves reflects on some of the big themes that will undoubtedly form a key part of the British ad industry conversation in the year ahead The economic bounceback of UK advertisingBroadcaster and journalist Nina Hossain prefaced the whole morning s programme by asserting thatthe ad industry business is boomingreferring to the Advertising Association and WARC figures released today that suggest that the UK s 2021 is set to have been the best ad trade recovery of any international market This was echoed in the address from Alessandra Bellinithe new Advertising Association president and chief customer officer and executive sponsor for D I at the British supermarket TescoAfter introducing herselftelling her story of a sceptical start as an apprentice at JWalter Thompson through to helping Tesco earn its place as one of the top 10 advertisers in the countryshe outlined several of the themes that would be discussed throughout RENEWWhile much of that agenda regards serious challengesher natural optimism shone through when she contextualised it all through the latest ad spend figuresshowing 2021 due to close as UK advertising s strongest year ever The UK s bounceback in 2021 is expected to be the largest across any major international art marketoutstripping the global average including USFrance and China by more than 12 percentage pointsSo advertising is well set to help the UK economy recover from the private pandemic It s traditional at these Advertising Association events to have a relevant politician show their appreciation for the value that the industry contributes to the British economy and the secretary of state for digitalculturemedia and sport Nadine Dorries took her chance to cheerlead the buoyancy of UK advertising I m so glad to see that the industry has made a remarkable comeback from Covidshe saidAd spend is expected to rise to a new high of26 7 billion this yearwhich is brilliantAdvertising is also the backbone of our creative industrieswhich more and more are the strongest sources of global power Reestablishing trustFor the past several yearsthe advertising industry in the UK has been soul searching about how public trust in it has been in decline for so longAnd today that theme resurfacedAlessandra s address acknowledged this established narrativemade central by previous AA president Keith Weed and noted that progress is being made We knew we had to behave our way to be more trustednot just talk about itshe said There is some positive newsshe notedshowing that favourability towards advertising is back on an upward trend in the last two to three yearsBut compared to other industries advertising is at the bottom of that listand this improvement is only in line with a general improvement in trustThere is much more to doshe concluded But thankfully AA research has shown how advertising can drive that trustDriving awareness of the Advertising Standards Authority regulations makes a substantial differenceas the AA s test campaign in Scotland demonstrated last yearThis will roll out a UK wide campaign this year againshe saidPut simplythe greater the public s awareness of the ASAthe more likely they are to trust the ads that they seeand the more they will trust advertising overallwhich is good for our business Culture secretary Nadine Dorries also focused on regulation in her speech to the eventnoting that with up to 70of people in the UK not trusting what they see onlinethe regulatory framework of online advertising will come under review by the government this spring as part of its online advertising programme Another discussion that revolved around the restoration of trust in advertising came from Peter Duffypresident of ISBA and CEO of moneysupermarketHis part of the conference focused on why true cross media measurement is an essential requirement for marketers nowReflecting on the insight that too much advertisingwastage and duplication drives declining trust among consumershe explained how Origin ISBA s cross media measurement project has been able to make progress because of the vital support it s had from many areas of the industryPlatformsagencies and advertisers have contributed funding to get this ambitious project off the groundWith greater measurementhe arguedsome of the practises that mark a decline in trust in advertising will be eliminated Advertising s positive role in societyOne of the ways Alessandra s opening address suggested that advertising can rebuild trust is by cementing itself as a force for good in people s mindsShe noted advertising s role in helping societysuch as its role in encouraging uptake of Covid 19 vaccines and boosters a moment that the culture secretary reflected on in her speech When we look it will be a potent symbol of advertising s power The session titledAdvertising s Super Powerwas a chance to reflect on the world bettering potential of advertising through three recent campaignsChaired by Nicola Kempeditorial director at Creativebriefthe panel session looked at the socially transformative work of Channel 4 in itsSuperHumanParalympic campaignthe National Centre for Domestic Violence sAbusers Always Work From Homecampaignand Dove sCourage Is BeautifulcampaignThe panel discussed how each found a creative way to address an issue honestly and effectively Ultimatelythis is the kind of work that restores the public s lost trust in advertisingWhich is a sentiment that a special film from Gogglebox for the event reinforcedIn itBritain s most famous TV watching households gathered to react to a curated ad break of communication including a government announcement around vaccine provisionan expression of deep yearning from Guinnesscuteness from Moonpig and exhilaration from TikTokIt was a reminder that entertaining people while they relaxis also a way that advertising can find a place in the public s hearts Nina Hossein and Seb MundenIndustry action to address the climate crisisTo ignore the urgency of the climate emergency at an event like RENEW 2022 would be unforgivableAnd Alessandra affirmed that action will bea central part of plans in the coming yearsfor the AAThere was plenty to talk about on this frontincluding the schemes that the industry body is involved withAd Net Zero and AdGreenboth of which the AA president urged everyone in the industry to take part in Seb MundenEVP and general manager at Unilever UK Irelandjoined Nina in the studio to discuss the 2022 agenda for Ad Net Zerowhich largely revolves around the introduction of the Ad Net Zero Certificationbecause supporters have asked for an industry specificgold standard certificationto be developed Seb said This new certification will allow agenciesproductionmediaand advertisers to be accredited for their work in reducing emissions from ad operations and promoting more sustainable products and lifestylesIt will embed best practiceprovide accountabilitysupport procurementand help organisations communicate progress to net zero to stakeholders to customersclientsemployeesand investors alikeOur aim is to launch the certification in Q3 He went on to update the action planOutlining five steps for the organisation 1Benchmarking industry carbon data2Encouraging measurement and reduction through tools like the AdGreen carbon calculator3Reducing impact of mediathrough more tools such as the IPA s media carbon calculator4Promoting sustainability reward categories and educating awards bodies accordingly5Ad Net Zero Global Summit alongside COP27 in EgyptFollowing thisa panel around the climate challenges of the industry outlined further considerations and tools to decarbonise advertisingClaire Shinedirector and CEOCISL kicked off with a very grounding thought for the industry I heard French commentators say recently about the failure of political ecologyhow people are torn between utter panic and utter boredomAnd here s why the ad sector is uniquely well positioned to think about how the conversation goes forward around this great human project of the 21st centurywhich is to regenerate a living and livable planet to have equity in life and life chances The three panellists showed examples of how some advertisers can do just thatAnna Lungleychief sustainability officer at Dentsu discussed the power of brands to raise awarenesschange perceptions and shift behaviour We cannot ignore the potential we have to drive positive changeshe saidbefore moving on to tangible steps around measurement becoming less opaquebut how it is key to the whole project of sustainability It will raise awarenessit will help us as an industry to understand our role in an ecosystem linked to consumption Strephanie Lamberthead of FMCG for Metareturned to the refrain of the event We know we have a trust challengereminding us that 71of advertising professionals in the UK are concerned about the impact we are having on the environmentShe also touched on how a sector designed to drive consumption needs to find ways to drive success for clients as well as reducing emissions and averting the worst of the ecological crisisFor this we need to go back back to the design stageshe saidwhere 80of the environmental impact of a product is determinedWe also must educate people in the industry tocreate a wave of changemakersat every level of an organisationshe said GoogleLara Naqusbandidirector of lifestyle retail outlined how a massive company like hers was making progress to becoming net carbon zero by 2030while at the same time empowering others with toolssuch as showing Maps users the most eco friendly routesbuilding a tool to help pick the most sustainable flights and hotels and even home appliances Improving inclusion in advertisingAnother topic that would be unacceptable to ignore is the dire lack of diversity among those working in the UK advertising sectorAlessandra s presidential keynote addressed this by updating us on the AA s All In initiativewhich conducted an industry wide census of 16 000 in 2021 Some of these numbers should really make us reflectshe said According to the censusonly 1of UK advertising s senior leaders are Black While senior leaders are made nearly 40women on averagea female senior leader earns 10less than their male counterpart Those in the industry are three times as likely to be privately educated much higher than the national average Working class people are underrepresented at 19versus 39of the working population Only 20of the industry are aged over 45 versus 44of the working population A quarter of minority ethnic employees said they were likely to leave the industry due to lack of inclusion or feeling discriminated against Three in 10 employees suffered from stressanxiety in the past 12 months 22of disabled people have been bullied or undermined To truly deliver on its full potential in terms of financial contributioncreativity and career prospectsThis industry needs to look beyond stage of life or even state of life when recruitingretaining and nurturing employeessaid Alessandra In a deeper drill down into what All In has been doinglater in the eventannounced improving the experience and representation of womenAsian talent and older talent as the next three actions for the initiativeadding to All In actions covering Black talentdisabled talent and working class talent A panel representing each of these three groups discussed the biggest barriers to inclusion and various ways they are being challengedKate Watersdirector of client strategy and planning at ITV and president of WACL identified aglass pyramid effectat work in the industryin which the more senior a job level isthe less representation of women is foundOverallthe depressing consequence of all of this is that actually women end up being six times more likely to feel discriminated against because of their gendershe said And I think it s no surprise therefore that around 15one in six of women in the industryare thinking about leaving as a result of that discrimination and as a result of their experience She noted that flexible working for all genders should be a key strategy to address these issuesThat doesn t just mean working from homebut job sharespart timecompressed or flexible hoursShe also added that a good first step for companies trying to address their gender imbalance would be taking WACL s Flexible First Checklist a self assessment tool to guide you through aspects of flexible working that you need to think about as a business leader Providing a perspective from the Asian advertising communityShez Iqbal reflected on his response to the census The results were difficult to digestbut not surprisingsaid the mentor at MEFA and director of publisher partnerships at CriteoFor example27of Asian respondents reported they were likely to leave the industry due to a lack of inclusion or experiencing discrimination and the largest group within that felt this were Muslim That s 32of Muslims who are likely to leave our industry due to their life experiencesand Hindus at 27and Sikhs at 23are just behindhe said Shez did have suggestions for positive steps that have been shown to work in addressing this thoughincluding external support to make Asian talent feel more included within an organisationsuch as the mentoring he does at MEFAor simple steps like ensuring there are prominent non alcoholic options at events Anna Dalzielfounder of 40 Over Forty and SVP marcomms at Momentum Worldwide joined to speak about the industry s ageism issuesThe polling datashe notedshowed that only 4of respondents were aged 55 to 64compared to 17of the UK populationAnd most of those over 55 who took part in the reportwere in C suite roles It shows that an alarming 43of respondents felt age limited their careershe saidAnna pointed to both conscious and unconscious ageism clearly demonstrated by these figures One practical response to this is the All In Shared Experiences policywhere people working within the advertising industry who ve got over 15 years experience can be paired with people with under five years experience to learn from each other It s not a mentor in schemeper sesaid Anna It s more around reverse learningand that s important to say because both people are equally learning from each otherAnd both parties have got knowledge to share Kate emphasised the need for clear action planslike these now the scale of the industry s problems have been revealed The wake up call for me to the industry is to recognise that these experiences are being lived and feltyou knowday in day outIf we want to deal with the talent crunch that we find ourselves inwe ve got so many good peoplewe have to listenwe have to respond to what they re saying The panel of Julian DouglasAndrew LowdonSimon Gunning and Kate MageeEnsuring the quality of working life in adland (even during pitches)In a session titledBuilding Back a Better IndustryJulian Douglas president of the IPA and international CEO and VP at VCCP and Andrew Lowdondirector of agency services at ISBA gave the audience an exclusive first look at the Pitch Positive Pledge a cross industry plan initiated by the IPA that is aimed at making the pitching process more intentionalaccountable and responsible for advertisers and agencies According to Julianprevious pitch guides have focused on thehow toof pitching without due consideration to the human and environmental costsThis initiativehe explainsseeks to address this by also focusing on thewhy and whenof pitchingBy committing to the cross industry Pitch Positive Pledgethe IPA and ISBA believe agenciesadvertisers and their staff will experience better outcomes includingbetter mental healthless wastagefewer costs and bettermore effective work Joining Julian and AndrewKate Mageeeditor of Management Todaylooked back on a piece she wrote for Campaign about the human cost of the workplace culture the Pledge is looking to challenge Speaking to thehard nosed agency bosses and clients among youKate emphasised that the culture that is leading to extensive burnout in this industrywill harm your bottom line because at a basic level the quality of the work will suffer This was echoed by Simon Gunning from mental wellness charity CALMwho knows from his own experience in advertising that the pitch process is unquestionably burning people out You learn that the person that wins is the person that negates human values as effectively as they possibly can and pummels everybody into a state of submission around them Simple suggestions to actively change this culturethe panel suggestedincluding avoiding setting deadlines on a Mondaywhich inevitably assume weekend workor over Christmaswhen people need time to recharge ahead of the new year Be thoughtful about the human impact of what you re asking of peoplesaid Kate Leaders have got a duty of care to proactively manage the workloads of their staff Attracting and retaining talent relies on all of this and moreAs sick of the talent crunch and the headlines aboutthe great resignationas we may all beall of the topics discussed at RENEW 2022 are crucially linked to that issue too The challenges of attracting people to join our industry and to build their careers here must not be underestimatedWe re going to have to compete hard for the best people nowand in the futuresaid Alessandra in her opening addressAnd the discussions that followed helped to flesh out the direction of travel each companyleader and employee in our industry needs to be heading inthrough small actions Top downthe AA announced a Talent Taskforce of industry leaders todayto ensure UK advertising meets this challengeThis new Taskforce will review the industry s strategy to attract and retain the best talent and understand how the advertising workforce can better represent the diversity of its audienceIt will be aligned with the work of All Inwhich has provided the most detailed data yet on the make up of the industry and the systemic changes needed to retain talent through a more inclusive workplaceBut the small actions we all take will add up to the general perception of the industry True to her Tesco cultureAlessandra s keynote ended on a shopping list for the advertising industry that shethe AA and probably most of the industry wanted to seeAnd if we can get all of these things in our basket in 2022we ll be on our way to beating some of the weighty challenges UK advertising faces '},\n",

did our classic editorial end of year recap for 2021This year we surveyed our editorial group but we also invited a group of our readers to meet with us and validate our analysisThis was part of our new year s resolution from 2020 to engage more deeply with our readers and ensure that we were providing not just engagingbut more relevant contentWe have put in place a process that allows us to take your feedback on all articles we publishand many of you have shared your commentsWe read each and every one These in person sessions allow usat least virtuallyto talk directly to our readers and hear what they have to sayClearlyour year end group agreed 2021 was a tough year for IT We also discussed the key technology themes developments stories of 2021 and we d like to share those with all our readersHere they are at least as we see themWe d love to have your opinionYou can share that with us at the end of the articleselect the check mark for agreement or the X for disagreementIn either caseyou ll be asked if you also want to send your comments directly to our editorial team ReadyHere s our analysis of the themes of 2021If it s too much to handle in one sittingyou can come back and jump straight to a section by clicking on its name in the table of contents Contents IT under attack cybersecurityprivacy and complianceIt s no surprise that cybersecurity was the biggest news theme of 2021Issues of security privacy and compliance have been news for many yearsBut if prior years featured attacks and skirmishesthis year turned to all out warwith IT on the front lines Ransomware has been a special threat for years nowMalware that encrypts your data and demands an untraceable ransom in bitcoin is an evilalbeit creative synergyRansomware is also unique in that it is a businessand an exceptionally profitable oneThe perpetrators are a well organized and professional set of cybercriminalsThey are well funded and have more than technical resources they have marketingpromotion and a perversely efficientcustomer serviceA friend of mine who was at the time CIO of a large developer once quipped that the help desk that assists companies to learn to pay ransoms in bitcoin was better than anything he d seen in corporate ITThis combination of factors has led to explosive growth As ransomware threats have growncompanies developed greater defencesFundamental to this is better and highly tested backupsoften with one version stored in read only format and unconnected to any systems or networksTo mitigate the need to pay ransom to recover encrypted datawhite knights developed and posted decryption keysWe even saw the emergence of paid negotiators who were engaged to try to minimize ransom amounts In responsethe ransomware crooks evolvedThey developed new approaches such assteal and revealwhere they stole data before encrypting it and threatened to reveal it if not paid the ransomOftentimes they made good on their threatsIf this failed to worksome added new threats like distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) that rocked the internet with the attack volumes 2021 brought a huge expansion and ramp up of these attacksThis massively expanded distribution featured what some might call a channel or franchise strategyThe cyber gangs provided the threat and infrastructurebut rented this out to let others deliver the attacks The attacks spread everywheretaking down companies of all sizesall industries and all sectorsThey also went after targets that previously would have been unheard of or perhaps untouchable hospitalsclinics and other critical infrastructure With this widespread threatpopular media picked up the storyNot a day went by without a new attackBusinesses were shut for weeks and even monthsCosts were in the hundreds of millions of dollarsCyber insurance premiums skyrocketed This struck fear into boards of directorsmany of whom had previously seemed mildly oblivious to security threatsSuddenly cybersecurity was an existential threat to their businessesEven legislatorswho are often technically cluelesshave been jarred to attention Yetalthough ransomware was the poster child of 2021it was only one of many threatsPhishingsocial engineeringDDoS attacks proliferated as well But another insidious threat hit in 2021 which attacked what we could call the soft underbelly of ITThe so called supply chain threat saw trusted suppliers of software and foundation libraries become targetsThese attacks spread widely and hit every level of business and governmentFrom Solar Winds to the year end Log4j exploitsnew threats spread across a massive number of applications and infrastructuresIt left exasperated IT staff shaken not knowing what or who to trust This is why 2021in our opinionis the year of IT under attack Privacy compliance business takes the hitSince the prime threat in the new cyberwars is the theft and publication of private datait s not surprising to see an impact in the areas of privacy and compliance Once againthis is not a new storyConsumers have long been lax in giving up their data and privacy for free entertainmentAccording to a year end Washington Post poll82 per cent of them say the resultant ads areannoyingand 74 per cent say they areinvasiveand 7 out of 10 people polled thought their phones were listening to themYet fewif anywere prepared to give up access to social media or mobile devices This has left governments struggling to figure out how to protect the publicWhile many different jurisdictions have announced and implemented regulation and legislationthe gold standard has been the European Union developed General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)This set of regulationswith its strong process requirementssent shock waves around the world as companies and even countries started to up their game to keep up GDPR proved to be an impetus for regulators in other jurisdictionsas countries across the world sought to update their own privacy legislationIf an entity as large and diverse as Europe could come to an agreement on standardscertainly other jurisdictions could as well Not necessarilyUS reaction reflected the current political stalemate that has paralyzed its own federal governmentleaving states like California and others to draft their own legislationIronicallyCanadathe country where the concept of Privacy By Design was invented by former Ontario privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukianhas also failed to advanceCanada s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) legislation remains in serious need of an update and the Canadian governmentin a minority parliamenthas not been able to get a new bill passed There is a legitimate debate about whether regulation as stringent as GDPR is warrantedor good for businessBut inconsistent or patchwork legislation and regulation create the only thing that business fears more than regulation uncertainty ComplianceThe current patchwork and the climate of fear have created the worst of all situationsRather than complying with clear standardscompanies are trying to force suppliers to meet their own interpretation of regulations and best practicesLegal departments in serious CYA mode are issuing a raft of privacy and security certification documentseach onein the absence of a standardunique The resultAs one CIO of a major Canadian company said recently I have one full time person just dealing with these certifications from our customersIn the current resource strapped enterprise environmentwe can sympathizebut what of the smaller companies who are struggling to be competitive in a COVID 19 world and can t afford that extra resource Workforce transformation and the Great Resignation2021 was the second year of work from home (WFH)Having tested the limits of the jobs that can be done remotelybusinesses still managed to cope and some even reported increases in productivityAs the months went oneven the staunchest advocates of return to the office had to accept thenew normalWe began to see large numbers of employees who indicated that they may not return to the office at all76 per cent of workers do not want to return to the office full time according to Future Forum report from October of 2021An ITBusiness story noted that for tech workersthat figure was closer to 90 per cent Furtheran Ipsos Reid poll from June of 2021 noted that close to 30 per cent of workers would quit if forced to return to the office In our second yearwe saw the cracks appearWhile the initial reporting on WFH indicated increased productivitystressisolationand burnout threaten to erase those gains and perhaps drive productivity to lower levelsAs one CIO remarked we may have developed the tools to work remotelybut we haven t developed the culture As the never ending pandemic moved onmany employees began to question what they wanted from workWe began what has been termedthe great resignationemployees were leaving their jobs in record numbersNo longer limited by geography

Canada NewsYet even those who are willing and able to pay top salaries are not able to find the people they need Cloud outages and failuresIt is ironic that the origins of the Internet came from experiments in how a communications network could survive a nuclear attackand over the yearsit has been the subject of many doomsday predictionsNone of these digital Armageddons ever occurred Todaywhat we call the cloud has become a key part of our infrastructure and an essential component of the architecture of ITWe have noticed that discussions of the cloud are no longer simply about remote serversThey are sophisticated discussions of how the cloud fits into complex IT ecosystemsHaving achieved almost universal acceptance and high levels of adoptioncould it be that the cloud has finally shown its cracks and vulnerabilities This is the year that we all learned that a globally linkedInternet dependent IT amounted to a single point of failureWe learned that DNS issues or even a relatively simple implementation mistake could take down not a single companybut a huge number of companies with global size and reachWe discovered that in an agile world where implementations happen daily and even hourlythe potential for error grows exponentiallyAs we write thisthree large cloud provider data centre outages have occurred in the past two weeks and those are just the ones that made the news Those cloud outages have reinforced how dependent we all are on uninterrupted and ubiquitous computing servicesThey also exposed how interdependent businesses and networks areA cloud outage doesn t just cause one company to go down it takes down a large number of companies and their dependent suppliers Despite the fact that many of the big failures of the year which paralyzed cloud dependent companies for hours and even days were not the result of a cyberattack but more oftencarbon basedhuman error many companies are reassessing their cloud strategyTo be clearthis isn t a retreat from the cloudbut it is a hard look at how to mitigate failures of what was previously thought as too big to fail Supply chains chokeOur world has been transformed into an internationally integrated andjust in timesupply chainIn 2021 we discovered the vulnerabilities this createdA single point of failure could cause large problemseven paralyze companies and entire industries The North American supply chain was already under the gun as the pandemic rolled onIT was hit by a double whammy of increased fuel costs and a shortage of truck driversThe pandemic closed borderswhich interrupted integrated manufacturing in automotive and other key industriesThese led to shortages and increased prices Then the global supply chain also demonstrated its vulnerabilityA ship got stuck in a canal across the globe and worldwide supplies of critical goodspartsand components were instantly haltedBecause many were stuck on ships trapped in the canal backupcontainers required elsewhere to ship goods were not availableUnexpected and unintended consequences turned interruptions into crises We also saw vulnerabilities appear in productionThe consolidation of semiconductor manufacturing offshore meant that when one supplier had issuesit would lead to huge shortages of the chips that power the infrastructure of our digital economyWe needed new large scale computers as well as PCsmonitorsphonesand other devices to equip a new work from home economyAuto manufacturers lacked the chips that now are essential in carsAppliance manufacturers faced similar issuesAs of year endour podcastHashtag Trendingreported that memory chips were being scalped for as much as 5 times their original cost Thus one point of failure caused problems that rippled through companiesindustries and economiesFrom a single fracture pointa shortage of key components held up growth and stalled progressWe learned that in addition tojust in timewe might need another planjust in case Social media falls from graceIn 2020 we became aware of how deeply social media had become part of our information fabricIn 2021 the impact of the spread of disinformation by social media became an enormous threatA rumour that the US election had been stolen came close to bringing down a major western democracyA third of the US population refused to take a vaccine which objective science shows decreases risk of illness and vastly diminishes risk of deathThey chose instead to believe conspiracy theories from social mediaPeople who claimed that the vaccine would allow Bill Gates to track them posted videos from their cell phones ironicallydevices that could actually allow them to be tracked In 2021 we all learned that social media was not just an unwitting channel leveraged by some bad actorsIt was not simply madness of the mobmedia leaks and whistleblowers pointed out to us that this malevolence was a feature not a bugThe business model of social media led it to profit from the misuse of personal informationThe algorithms that drove consumption favoured disinformation and antisocial behavioursand they knowingly turned a blind eye as what their own studies acknowledged came true young women were tragically victimized Facebook s name change to Meta was just a final indication that social media platforms had not only come under scrutinythere was a growing backlash against these giantsone not limited to FacebookUS politiciansmany of whom are technologically illiteratewere expressing concern and even lashing out at not just social mediabut the entire tech industry Related OverexposureSome things that made news in 2021 might be described by quoting another famous authorWilliam Shakespearewhen he wrote full of sound and furysignifying nothingNothing might be a little

computation Few understand how quantum computing actually worksbut that didn t stop us from imagining a new quantum futureComputers would be so powerful that they would break even complex encryption routinesnothing would be secure We were fascinated in 2021 by the announcements of new computers which represented quantum leaps (pun intended) in processingYet despite those advancesmuch more needs

left us all with three key questionsWill the pandemic ever be overWhat will work look like in 12 monthsAndfinallywhat the hell is the metaverse A term borrowed from science fiction and popularized by movies like The Matrix entered our vocabulary in 2021It started with attempts to develop more engaging digital meetingsIt ended with an announcement by Mark Zuckerberg that his companyMeta (the company formerly known as Facebook) was going to build a new metaverse on the foundations of the social media giant that he built What is a metaverseThere is no universally accepted definitionIt will undoubtedly be some kind of virtual or augmented reality that creates a place where humans can interact and possibly collaborate in a newly defined digital spaceWhether that space is singular or composed of many different spacesonly one thing is certain those whoownor control the metaverse will have a commercial property that will dwarf the value of FacebookGoogle and perhaps all of our digital giants This is why Zuckerberg was so eager to jump from the battered reputation of Facebook to this new cyberworldeven though it is years from any practical realizationAnd with all due respect to Zuckerberghe might not want to spike the football avatar just yetThere is no doubt that Facebook is a monolithic forcebut the stakes are too high for other giants to roll over and let Zuckerberg claim victory There are real and practical barriers to building this metaversewhatever form it takesAccording to Intel and they should know the amount of computing power required will be as much as 10X the power we have today Yeteven though it is only an idea at this pointwe cannot ignore itNo matter how jaded we might beno matter how much we might think that this is a huge danger to humanityno matter how many obstacles we place in its wayhistory tells us that the metaverse will be builtBy whom and by whenwe simply don t knowBut it will be built The good news is that as we move towards the metaversewe will see developments in digital meetings and augmented reality as key stepsTech that we discardedlike the Google glasswill resurfacealbeit with greater utilityThe need for more interactive meetings may prove to be the real driver of progressparticularly if COVID 19 s Omicron variant and others continue to keep us from live meetingsLikewisedigital twinning creating 3D simulations that we can interact with will also be a compelling step forward While we won t be living the reality of a full experience digital worldwe will undoubtedly take steps forward in the coming yearExpect an abundance of things that are defined as the metaverseIt will be overhyped at a level we have not yet seenbut despite thatit s still an idea that is most likelyunstoppableJust don t

       "  'cuerpo': '5Gfoldables and digital transformation are set to remain big themes in 2022but sustainability will also really start to impact user decisionsWe asked the industry for their take on the year ahead2021 proved another unpredictable year as the pandemic continued to impact businesseswith the mobile industry no different But what can we expect from 2022To get a sense of how things may pan out in what s sure to be another busy yearMobile News got in touch with many well known faces in the industry to gather their predictions Spoiler alert they include 5Gchipsets and foldable smartphonesBut sustainability is also set to grow as a real factor in user decisions Adam Sweeneyhead of marketingData SelectThe mobile channel remains acquisitive as resellers look to enhance their capability and scale so I would expect further consolidation throughout the yearwith several large deals With each iteration of foldable devicesthe use case becomes clearerthe products better and the prices lowercombining to drive uptake and make them more mainstream Separatelysustainability will remain in the spotlight as consumers further scrutinise a brand s credentialsAnd while the secondary market is thrivingconsumers are also expecting devices to last longer thus increasing the length of replacement cycles It is no secret that the mobile device brands want users to take as many of their connected products as possible so expect to see greater storytelling focused on their individual ecosystemsas this not only increases their net promoter scorea measure of customer experiencebut aims to slow brand switching For two yearswe have all been navigating some form of WFHworking from homegiving rise to hybrid workingThis momentum has brought forward years of digital transformation in a matter of months in some instances This is set to continuewith smartphonestablets and computing at the heart of accessing corporate networks driving the need for greater device management and security

and beyondlow latency edge computingdigitally reimagined infrastructure management and sustainable networking practices all assisted with purpose built artificial intelligence will play increasingly large roles Alan Bentleyhead of global strategyBlanccoAs we move into a post pandemic worldwe believe that sales of packages for mobile device protection will increase in 2022 for two key reasonssmartphones growing more technologically advancedand more expensiveeach year These trends provide operators with additional opportunities to help consumers and businesses realise the value in protecting the investment in their new smartphones Not only do device protection subscriptions enable businesses to assess the value in the fleet of devices they ve leased or purchasedbut they also benefit consumerswho expect an enhanced customer experience that protects their device across its entire lifecycle We predict that this shift in user expectations and the need for businesses to protect their large investment in smartphones will stimulate growth in subscriptions and revenue streams for operators Ben CoullCEO and founding partnerCrystalusionMeaningful commitments on corporate social responsibility and heightened consumer understanding of our responsibility to reduce the individual impact we have on the planet will drive forward the industry focus on recycling and sustainabilityand accelerate the shift to a circular economy The implementation of the right to repair directive and the ongoing global shortage of semiconductors will focus companies on device refurbishment and component recoverywith networks and corporates vying for dominance in this lucrative space Howeverthere will also be great opportunities for start ups and agile SMEs to gain significant presence in this area This further shift towards a circular economy should jump start a rise in repairrelated services and tutorials such as iFixit and with the shortage of component for new devices likely spanning into Q4consumer purchasing behaviour will shift heavily towards refurbished devices and could deliver the biggest industry growth of 2022 in this area The shift to refurbishment and recovery could also be good news for the insurance and protection sectorand for any business with an interest in increasing the device lifecycle Ben Woodchief analyst and CMOCCS InsightLooking back just a couple of yearsfew of us would have believed the turmoil that the industry would face because of a pandemic That challenge continues into 2022so making predictions is as difficult as everBut as always at CCS Insightour analysts have put their heads together and come up with a lengthy set Sustainability remains a hot issueand I feel that phone makersgreen credentials are becoming an increasingly important part of consumerspurchase decisions The market leadersApple and Samsungare each selling more than 300 million electronic devices worldwide each yearAs an increasing proportion of the population becomes aware of the links that mobile phones have to excessive consumptionthis is going to become an issue Although activities such as offsetting carbon emissions and using recycled materials are importantthere is a risk that they will fail to convince some peopleAll phone makers are going to have to prove that they are genuinely committed to change Another interesting prediction is that support for 3G technology will disappear from leading smartphones by 2025I predict that Apple will kick start this trend by removing 3G support from the new iPhone in 2023This will help it reduce antenna complexity and licensing costs While some mobile operators have already outlined plans to reuse their 3G spectrum and switch off services using the technologythe decision will undoubtedly result in an outcry in the media Howeveras with other decisions such as the removal of the 3 5mm audio jackthe trend will spread to other phone makers and 3G support will probably disappear from all major new smartphones by 2025 One final predictionwhich came from my CCS Insight colleague Martin Gartneris a topical one given the scrutiny and news flow on MetaFacebookHe predicts that by the middle of 2023Meta s family of users will outnumber Christianity and Islam put together The basis is that the number of monthly users of at least one of Facebook s stable of services FacebookWhatsApp and Instagram was 3 5 billion in the second quarter of 2021Growth has also accelerated during the pandemic anddespite a potential slowdown as it easesthe company could still reach 4 4 billion monthly active users by mid 2023 At that pointit becomes larger than Christianity and Islam put togetherwhich account for about 4 3 billion people today Britt Megaheyfounder and managing directorBarclay CommunicationsAfter 25 years of working in the telecoms industryI know how volatile the market can beAdd to this an ongoing global pandemic and we are set for yet another unpredictable year ahead Howeverif my experience has taught me anythingit s that change is guaranteed and that embracing it can mean the difference between success and failure As a businesswe have learnt to build a roadmap that is adaptable as the market changesand this is no different in 2022 It ishoweverimportant that we use our knowledge to forecast how the market might look going into a new year to allow our teams to plan and make decisions regarding the direction of the business In 2022I forecast that there will be an increase in business acquisitions to consolidate the market The past two years have proven difficult for some firms to provide the confidence and reliability that customers require For exampleproviders that offer a single product solution will find it difficult to compete against the larger telecoms firmswhich have the ability to offer multiple products and solutions such as landline and IT services The rollout of 5G will ramp up significantly this year as more businesses come on board seeking better coverage and faster data streamingpaired with the increased availability of cheaper compatible handsets Both businesses and consumers will become less focused on price and more on the importance of reliabilityflexibilitycustomer services and additional benefits With uncertainty still high within the industrybuyers are looking for a provider known for excellent service and that can reliably offer multiple products under one roof 2022 will be the year that telecoms firms see the real importance of IT infrastructure and stability to support their solutions and servicesProviders will seek to bring talent in house and develop a knowledge hub that serves their customersinterestsThis will help increase delivery speed and improve loyalty Although the mobile market continues to be unpredictableit s important that providers keep their customers at the forefront of decision making Businesses should strive to build loyalty and ensure they

exciting year for the industry Gareth Elliotthead of policy and communicationsMobile UK2022 is set to be a busy yearespecially after (or if ) COVID restrictions are lifted further Mobile coverage will increasingly reach into all parts of the UK as operators begin the drive to extend this via the shared rural networkwhile 5G could help hit the government s target for the majority of the population to be covered by one or more operators before the year is out The likelihood of this being achieved will be significantly enhanced if new planning regulations come into force early in the yearfollowed

has accelerated the move to online shopping for the elderlynew trends and developments are impacting the spending preferences of that demographic There has been an increase in demand for products that tie in with a wider ecosystem rather than standalone devicesa trend that we re going to see accelerate in 2022 IoT systems will unlock great opportunities for the senior marketbut to have the strongest impact they must be clear and straightforward to use We ve seen that senior users are favouring well designedeasy to use devices that give them access to the latest apps and communications platformsyet come equipped with design features more suited to their needs For somethis may be hearing aid compatibilitywhile for others it s the ability to grant their relatives remote access to help them tweak the settings on their phone or even added safety features to support them in times of emergency As the role of the family care circle becomes more integrated into support and technology for senior users in 2022these are features that will become all the more valuable Phil KemishCEO and co founderReboxedGiven the lack of innovation in new handsetsI predict a continued market deflation in new sales with a shift coming due to negative public perceptions of new tech and its effects on the environment Our consumption habits are shifting and the rise of the conscious consumer is hereThese trendscoupled with rising pricesthe economic climate and the working from home revolutionplus a slower than predicted recovery from the pandemicwill only speed up the refurb and reboxed tech revolution This will lead to higher than predicted refurbished device salesgetting to a third of market share by 2025 I also believe there will be a fundamental increase in the proportion of the

will change the way that consumers and retailers interactand how they build future proofsustainable business models for the next generation Rebecca Bromwichglobal account managerVodafoneI don t believe that 5G smartphones will reach critical mass in 2022as owning a 5G handset still requires the network infrastructure for it to work on And despite most networks rolling out in earnest nowthere don t appear to be many more advantages to the consumer beyond speed just yet It s a different story for businesseshoweveras they realise the power of what 5G can enableI predict that private 5G will become far more prevalent in 2022as digital transformation requires 5G capability for critical infrastructure Smart factories and industrial operations are just two areas that will be dependent on the technologywhich could add6 4 billion to the value of the UK manufacturing industry aloneaccording to a Vodafone studyCompanies without 5G will soon be at a competitive disadvantage Last year s COP26 climate change conference highlighted sustainability like never beforeand businesses will begin looking more towards services such as IoT to support them in their strategy of reducing their carbon

formfactor innovationit won t be surprising if other disruptive brands look to flex their muscles in their respective R D departments to show the world what they re capable of and what the future of handset manufacturing looks like while handset cameras and sensorscombined with clever softwarewill continue to push boundaries While the UK hasn t been the quickest to adopt 5Guptake will no doubt accelerate in 2022 compared to previous years as the technology slowly begins to move towards being the norm and UK consumers are more connected to their electricals than ever before Howeverwe ll see the biggest leaps in 5G coming from the B2B segmentwith organisations starting to really capitalise on the technology as we move into a new world and new industrial revolution As UK consumers continue to demand more from their network providersbrands will have no choice but to offer new and creative value adds to their customers to maintain momentum and relevancyleading to customer retention These are likely to come in the form of creative and clever partnerships rather than a simple race to the bottom on price There will be a continued global effort from both organisations and consumers to become greener and more consciousas a resultwe ll likely see a bigger rise in recycling and trade in initiatives than in previous years Russ ErnstEVPproducts and technologyBlanccoAs we move into 2022device trade ins show no sign of slowingCarriers and operators will continue to pursue aggressive marketing tactics and buyback schemes something that peaked again last autumnwith AT T offering a staggering1 000 off the iPhone 13 with qualifying trade ins One driver for this is an appetite to upgrade to 5G deviceswith the technology impelling the upgrade cycle as enterprises and individuals become increasingly reliant on their mobile to support the flexible work model and for faster data transmission and use in remote settings Carriers and operators will also maintain attractive buyback offers to meet with continuously growing secondary market demandbut also to help meet supply chain challengesSome OEMs face shortages in materialsso expect trade ins to prop up those businesses as they look to harvest materials for reuse in the manufacture of new smartphones Sarah Edgesales director UK and IrelandSOTIAs we move into 2022the use of IoT and mobile services is rising exponentiallyand businesses must ensure that their infrastructure is prepared As networks grow to connect billions of devicesthere is a possibility that centralised systems will turn into bottlenecksThese systems will require huge investmentsboth financially and technologicallyto ensure that data is handled efficientlywith many businesses relying on valuable insights to streamline their operational processes and increase their return on investment For enterprisesthe challenge is how to efficiently manage multiple IoT devices across large geographical areasSimply keeping track of huge amounts of data being generated from devices in a range of different locations and from an assortment of vendors is already a serious issueand is likely to be the biggest IoT challenge faced by IT departments this year Enterprises need to have one integrated device management strategy to run their IoT ecosystem as simply as possible and have full visibility of every single end pointThis will enable enterprises to maximise the value of the data collectedwhile ensuring that security is still a top priority The onus is on businesses to effectively operate multiple IoT devices as this technology increasingly becomes a lifeline to industries such as retailhealthcaretransportation and logistics In a post pandemic worldongoing digitalisation is key to efficient mobility operationsand more companies will implement IoT automation into their business models to obtain a data driven understanding of operations Organisations that have an effective business mobility strategy and can integrate operations with their IoT infrastructure will inevitably overtake the competition Shez CheemaCEOTela TechnologyWe expect to see further developments in machine learning and AI in 2022as well

portals Additionallycloud platforms like Azure allow businesses to build new application architectures that are resilient and agileenabling rapid response and scalability with changing demand We ll also see companies taking a wider view to protect their lifeblood data and demonstrate that they have proper cybersecurity accreditations and protection to coincide with the new technologies being implemented Simon FabbdirectorLease GroupFollowing the themes of 2021hybrid working will be at the heart of how businesses operatebut with more mobilisation as events and external meetings resume This

for dealersand I anticipate that the average mobile spend will increase as businesses look to deploy devices with the capacity and processing power to deliver on these solutions Tommi Uittopresident of mobile networksNokiaDespite another year of ongoing disruption and uncertaintymobile network operators have continued to expand their 5G footprints with coverage set to continue being built out at full speed throughout 2022 Population and geographic coverage will improve fastMore and more operating licences will be awardedas there are still countries whose regulators have not yet awarded 5G licences We will also see a greater push for defining 5G Advanced technologydeveloping the fifth generation to its fullest capabilities This development will look to expand connectivity by enabling service providers to enhance their networks in four dimensionsexperienceexpansionextension and operational excellenceAlbeit not due until 2024there is no doubt it will capture the imagination of the telecoms industry in our nearer term future 5G Advanced will also lay the groundwork for the sixth generationhelping make important use cases and technological improvements possiblebut operators have a lot to answer beforehand They must consider how their networks will evolve to handle the longer term impact of drivers like human augmentation (increasingly immersive experiences and enhanced human computer interfaces) and digital physical fusion (connecting every physical thing that makes sense to connect digitally) And it doesn t stop thereMNOs will also need to embrace both performance and energy efficiencyand keep finding ways to provide scalable mobile network coverage and capacity to outpace current demandThat will be a critical priority this year '},\n",

construction of data centressupport the construction of other infrastructuresuch as for 5Gand help roll out off grid solar power generation and electric vehicle manufacturing Europeans should work in joint ventures with African firms as this model is proven to create value added that China s investments often fail to produce The EU should merge its nascent Global Gateway international connectivity programme with the European Green DealThe objectives of both require similar levels of investment in African infrastructure and they can unlock the investment potential of European public private partnerships IntroductionEconomic and commercial relationships with Africa are set to play an ever greater role in determining countriesand blocsplace in the global economic orderBy 2025Africa will have over 100 cities with more than one million inhabitants more than three times the number in the European UnionBy 203042 per cent of the world s young people will live in Africamaking the continent home to the largest supply of affordable labour on the planet in the coming decadesAndwith an extremely extensive supply of inexpensive and available landAfrica is already attracting international businesses looking for affordable manufacturing sites MoreoverAfrica is the fastest growing end market for a widening range of productsThis means it is increasingly not just a place that makes things to exportbut is also home to important consumer markets that are underserved and set to rapidly expandThis trend will accelerate with the full implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Areawhich launched in January 2021 Much of this growth is being powered by the green energy innovation ecosystems that are emerging in sub Saharan Africathey are already defining the future trajectory of economic growth on the continentThese innovation ecosystems thrive by combining cutting edge digital technologies and telecommunications with renewable energy technologiesThey respond to Africa s unique market needs which include significant consumer demand for better digital connectivity and they make use of the considerable green energy potential of the continentThese ecosystems areby definitiona cross industry phenomenon in which growth in one sector supports growth in anotherSolar energyelectric vehiclesand telecommunications and information and communications technology (ICT) are all intimately interconnectedThey synergise with one another to create a virtuous cycle of market expansion for each sector Africa has seen growth in these sectors thanks to their interconnectednessFor examplethe expansion of digital financing platforms operating over mobile networks has enabled consumers to purchase off grid solar power systemsThe components needed for these systems are supplied by local solar panel manufacturing sectorsAccess to affordable power has enabled the development of new commercial markets for other goods and services Howeverit is far from assured that Europe will play a primary role in the new commercial architecture emerging in AfricaIndeedEurope s global economic competitiveness is at riskNow and in the coming yearsinternational actors will be racing to establish new manufacturing value chains a process that is shaping Africa s economy and boosting those actorspositions in the global economic orderIndeedin the last decadeChina overtook the EU to become Africa s top trading partnerand India became the continent s second largest such partnerTurkey s rate of growth in African trade surpassed the EU s by a factor of fivewhile the Gulf Arab states similarly expanded their trade and investment relationships with AfricaEven prior to the outbreak of covid 19EuropeanGulf Araband Asian states showed a growing interest in nearshoring shortening supply chains to bring them closer to intended end marketsThis interest has only increased in the time since European companies in Africa are forced to compete with Chinese counterparts that have the advantage of formidable state backingButwhen it comes to successful investment partnerships in Africabigger does not always mean betterChinese investments across the continent have not brought about a China style economic boom in any African countryEurope could fill this gap by investing in the creation of large scalevalue added production in sub Saharan AfricaTo do soEurope needs to deploy its resources in a coordinatedstrategic mannerThe EU urgently needs to combine the foreign policy aspect of its European Green Deal with its nascent Global Gateway programmewhich is its answer to China s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Form should follow functionAnd the function needed is a unity of action among EuropeansThough this is a perennial challengeEuropean policymakers should acknowledge that a Europe that fails to be a whole greater than the sum of its parts will inevitably be eclipsed by China and other competitorsSub Saharan Africa s economy is changing rapidlyEuropeans have an opportunity to be part of thisand to help promote economic growth while strengthening geopolitical ties with governments and businesses across the continentButto achieve thisthey will need to provide investment and other support that makes a real difference to Africa s growth trajectory Africa s and Europe s economic relationshipNew and enhanced global economic engagement with Africa in the last decade led to unprecedentedly high growth rates in several sub Saharan African countriesDubbed Africa slion economiesthese nations consistently experienced economic growth rates of more than 6 per centButwhile Europe has hesitatedother powers have stepped in to assume technological and commercial leadership roles and have strengthened their political ties with African countries in the processFor examplealmost half of the Chinese companies operating in Africa during the past decade have introduced a new product or service to the local marketwhile more than one third have introduced a new technology Such expansion has been to Europe s detrimentFar from beingthe morethe merrierthe value added production created in Africa by such powers has displaced Europe from various marketsreduced European revenuesand made it more likely that Europe will fall further behindSo farthe EU and its member states have failed to address this challengeresulting in a decline in Europe s political influence on the continent This has coincided with growing interest across the world in how to shorten key supply chainsIn the years immediately before the pandemicglobal supply chains were already becoming shorter as companies and countries placed greater emphasis on resilience over immediate cost efficiencyFor both European and non European companiesthis profound structural transformation meant bringing sourcing and manufacturing closer to European end marketsThe commercial imperative to maintain a low cost base while nearshoring has led to the establishment of new production facilities in AfricaSince the onset of the pandemicthis trend has accelerated as part of the competition among international actorsUndeterred by the severe economic impact of covid 19countries such as ChinaJapanSouth KoreaTurkeyQatarand the United Arab Emirates have expanded their economic involvement in sub Saharan Africa faster than Europe hasIn line with thiseach of these countries has improved its position in Africa s expanding end markets Turkey s economic activism in Africa Turkey s development of commercial architecture in the central Maghreb and west Africa is an illustrative example of a significant state actor s increasing involvement in the African economyBy establishing steel and textile manufacturing in AlgeriaTurkey has become that country s largest foreign employerundercutting the political influence of France and ItalyTurkey and its close partnerQatar which also opened a steel plant in Algeria now dominate the country s steel industryWithin the same time frameTurkey opened Africa s largest textile production plant also in AlgeriaAndfollowing this successTurkey has established a steel plant and a furniture factory in Senegalto serve the rapidly growing consumer markets there and in other parts of west AfricaTurkey s Senegalese furniture factory can benefit from other Turkish plants in both Senegal and Algeriawhich service its need for fabriccoiland other metal inputs for cost effectivevertically integrated manufacturingPoland is the world s second largest furniture exporterwhile GermanyItalyand the Czech Republic are in thirdfourthand ninth place respectively and Turkey is in tenth placeHoweverthese EU member states can expect to lose global market share to Turkey because of the way in which it has secured an advantageous position in the sub Saharan African market Sub Saharan Africa s green energy innovation ecosystemsThere are clear reasons for this interest in sub Saharan AfricaOne increasingly important factor has been the unprecedented growth in consumer markets that states and citizens in the region spurred through the early adoption of mobile banking and related digital finance servicesThese sectors have been a major driver of African consumer purchasesin 2019mobile technologies and services in sub Saharan Africa generated155 billion of economic value addedor 9 per cent of the region s GDPThe sector is projected to grow by 18 7 per cent by 2024to184 billion This astounding consumer market growth is being driven by local green energy innovation ecosystemsProfitabledigitaland low carbonthese ecosystems are now bringing about growth in other sectorssuch as solar power systems and electric vehicles products whose development is closely intertwinedFor examplethe rise in mobile banking in Africa using cellular networks is creating market demand for solar power adoption and electric vehicle useAs African countries roll out higher capacity cellular networks such as 4G and 5G in partnership with EuropeanChineseor other firms their infrastructure requires more power generationAnd the networksexpansion creates new incentives for businesses to generate and use more solar powerThe integration of digital platforms and mobile banking has enabled the large scale adoption of solar power by African consumersspurring an expansion of solar panel production in sub Saharan Africa The scale and pace of this change will continue to be considerableIn 2020 approximately 600 million people in sub Saharan Africa 48 per cent of the entire continent s population had no access to electricityYet the International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected thatby 2030renewable energy sources will power over 60 per cent of the region snew electricity access(a term referring to electricity for people who previously did not have electricity available to them)Almost half of this new supply will be provided by off grid photovoltaic (PV) solarsystems (and by mini grid PV systemswhich are local and small scale)In turnthe IEA states that the further adoption of off grid and mini grid systems will be facilitated by the use ofnew business models using digital and mobile technologiessuch as those noted aboveas people use apps to acquire and manage such systems To take another examplesub Saharan Africa has experienced a rise in digital car sharing and ride hailing servicesThese services operate over mobile networks and allow customers to access electric vehiclesthereby pushing up demand for energyelectric carsnetwork capacityand data storage capacityIn this wayAfrica s innovation ecosystems increasingly rely on the internet of things European firms are playing some role in these industriesbut are yet to achieve their full potentialThey risk leaving companies from other statessuch as Chinawith much more significant sway over these sectorsfuture development and potentially in political relationships with governments in the region ICTIn 2019 there were 447 million unique mobile device subscribers in sub Saharan Africa 45 per cent of people in the regionWhile 50 per cent of subscribers in the region use smartphonesthe GSM Association (GSMA) anticipates the smartphone adoption rate will reach 65 per centor 678 million usersby 2025 Europe s market position in Africa s next generationgreen energy innovation ecosystems will be influenced by the level of European firmsparticipation in sub Saharan Africa s transition to full 4G and 5G coverageIf Europeans are not involved in Africa s 4G and 5G rolloutsit will be harder for their companies to be part of other sectors in Africa s innovation ecosystemsThereforeboth European and African businesses have an interest in increasing African solar power generation to meet the additional energy demand these networks requireWhile the typical maximum power consumption of a 3G site is 4 808Wthis goes up to 6 877W for 4G and 11 577W for 5GAccordinglyupgrading 3G coverage in sub Saharan Africa to 4G would lead to an additional 43 per cent in power consumption at such sitesThe upgrade from 4G to 5G would involve a further 68 per cent rise in power consumptionThis is a clear and significant investment need that EuropeanChineseor other firms could address The scale of such investment is set to be substantialA 2019 International Monetary Fund report projected that establishing full 4G connectivity in sub Saharan Africa by 2025 would require14 billion in capital and operational costs the latter including energy consumptionThe report also estimated thatassuming the whole of Africa has full scale 4G by 2025it would cost57 billion to upgrade this to 5G by 2040Although 4G accounted for only 15 per cent of subscriptions in 2020 and 5G less than 1 per centcurrent forecasts suggest thatby 2026 4G will become more pervasivereaching 28 per centand that 5G will reach 70m subscriptions (equal to 7 per cent of total subscriptions)GSMA projects capital expenditure investment in infrastructure of between7 2 billion and7 5 billion each year from 2020 to 2025The association estimates that 5G will account for most of this capital expenditure from 2025 onwards Even though 5G usage is expected to reach only 7 per cent of subscribers by 2026the race to install 5G networks is about securing a market share in Africa s emerging cross industry ecosystems5G broadband cellular networks offer data speeds up to 100 times faster than 4G and can support up to 1m connected devices per square kilometrecompared to 100 000 for 4GThis makes the technology the gatekeeper of the internet of things meaning that whoever builds 5G networks will have an advantage over their competitors in the development of Africa s next generationcross industry applications European companiesroleThe early 5G rollouts undertaken in 2020 and 2021 demonstrate that network vendors already participating in Africa s cross industry ecosystems have a competitive advantage in the marketThe first 5G networks in sub Saharan Africa were launched in South Africa in 2020 by Vodacom and MTNVodacomwhich is majority owned by the British based Vodafoneused Nokia 5G technology while MTN used Huawei technologyIn March 2021Kenya became the second African country to launch 5G for public usethis was developed by Safaricom using Nokia network technology as well as Huawei network technologyKenya s use of Huawei in its 5G rollout in the face of intense opposition from the United States was rooted in the Chinese firm s central role in Safaricom s M PESA mobile banking service and derivative services such as M KOPA s solar power adoption programmewhich it enablesIn 2015 M PESA started using Huawei Mobile MoneyThis cemented Huawei s relationship with Safaricom and Vodafonewhich effectively holds a 40 per cent share in the Kenyan telecoms company Such digital financing services provide access to wider opportunitiesparticularly the upgrade of a country s entire telecoms network to 5GChinese telecoms companies have moved vigorously to gain this first mover advantage in other sub Saharan marketsFor exampleHuawei began deploying its digital financing platform in Ethiopia in May 2021 to power an Ethiopian version of M PESA called Telebirrprovided by Ethio Telecom In west AfricaChina s Kunlun Tech has developed a similar mobile banking services platform in Nigeria called OPayusing its Chinese Norwegian web browser subsidiary OperaOrangewhich originally launched its first mobile money transfer service in 2008began the rollout of completely mobile banking services in June 2020 across the regions of sub Saharan Africa the company serves This is particularly important for many sub Saharan African nationsThose that do not produce surplus oil and natural gas simply cannot afford the additional imported fuel costs required by the expansion and upgrade of network coverageMoreoverenvironmentallysub Saharan Africa cannot tolerate additional power generation from fossil fuelsparticularly high polluting but lower cost diesel fuelWhen Ericsson established basic network coverage for rural parts of Benin in 2015the company installed low power consumption base stations to enable them to run on solar powerThis avoided both the high fuel costs and emissions production associated with diesel generators Against this backdropthe development agencies of the EU and its member states need to view 4G and 5G expansion as important to increasing European participation in Africa s cross industry ecosystemsEurope s contribution to the growth of African economies will be closely influenced by the role its firms play in the rollout of telecoms infrastructure and service provisionThis will enable Europeans to have a greater influence in the development not only of these particular sectors but also of those that that ICT supportssuch as mobile services and renewable energy generation This is a key area in which European firms from different sectors can engage in joint activity with their African partnersEurope s current position in Africa is also limited by the lack of coordination between European network vendors Ericsson and Nokia and French telecoms giant Orangewhich has 130 million subscribers in Africa meaning that one in every ten Africans is an Orange customerEricsson and Nokia are the only European vendors present in Africabut they are not making a significant investment in infrastructure thereWhile Orange is surging aheadNokia and Ericsson are not following suitMeanwhileOrange is only

African consumers and businessesOrange has been explicit in stating it does not have enough European partners with sufficient commitment to African 5G network developmentAs a consequenceit is increasingly working with Huawei to meet its growth demands in sub Saharan AfricaAt the 2021 Mobile World ConferenceOrange CEO Stéphane Richard pointed out thatwhile his company is using Ericsson and Nokia technology for its European 5G servicesit is forced to work with Huawei in AfricaHe said that Huaweiinvested in Africa while the European vendors have been hesitating During 2020 and early 2021Ericsson launched network operations in Benin that standardised 4G operations and laid the groundwork for 5G in the countryThe company also introduced 4G coverage in Kenya and south west Ethiopiaa 5G service in Madagascarand an automation hub in Nigeria to pave the way for a 5G rollout and enabling greater access to the internet of thingsIn the same time periodNokia launched a 5G network in Togowest Africa s first 5G networkand the first 5G network in Kenya (along with Huaweias discussed above)In July 2021Nokia announced that it would be deploying a new network in Angola s capitalLuandato support the upgrade from 2G to 4G serviceswhich in future could be further upgraded to 5GThe network will be operated by Africellwhich obtained a100m loan from the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) facilitating Nokia s selection over HuaweiHoweverthese interventions remain small by comparison to othersand there is little sign that they will be scaled up enough to strengthen European influence on emerging innovation ecosystems Africell s rapid rise to become the market leader in the Gambia and Sierra Leoneand a major player in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congoresulted in part from the company s entry into mobile bankingThe DFC s support for Africell is an example of a government agency helping a telecoms company engage holistically with Africa s cross industry innovation ecosystems another important factor for Europeans to considerand to further integrate into their approach to engaging with sub Saharan Africa s emerging innovation economy Mobile banking and solar powerThe spread of ICT that can sustain mobile networks with greater capacity and geographical coverage has helped drive the development of other industriesincluding mobile bankingIncreased local solar power generation hasin turnbeen facilitated by the greater mobile network access and consequent ability of online financial services to create consumer markets by extending credit to those previously without accessExamples from across the continent demonstrate this dynamic situation Solinc is a joint African European manufacturing enterprise based in KenyaYetmuch of its success can be attributed to the emergence of local digital mobile financing platformsOriginally known as Ubbink East AfricaSolinc was formed in 2011 as a joint venture between Dutch manufacturer Ubbink and Kenyan battery maker Chloride ExideUsing an initial investment of3mthe company built a manufacturing plant that could produce 30 000 solar panels a yearBy 2016Solinc had increased its annual production capacity by more than 400 per cent to keep up with growing domestic demandIt has since begun selling in other east African markets and intends to further double its annual production capacityBy 2021the company had sold over 775 000 solar panelsamounting to 47MW of off grid solar power generation capacity equal to more than half of Kenya s 2019 installed PV capacity of 95MW This expansion was supported by Solinc s partnership with Kenyan mobile financing businesses such as M KOPAFeaturing in MIT Technology Review s 50 Smartest Companies in 2017 M KOPA pioneered the development of an online pay as you go (PAYG) model that combined digital micropayments with internet of things connectivity( Kopaincidentallyis the Kiswahili word forloaning ) The firm has used its sophisticated mobile platform to provide400m in financingThis hasin turnenabled 1 million African mobile subscribers to purchase off grid solar power and some of the technologies that use such powerincluding energy efficient lightstelevisionsrefrigeratorsand smartphonesThis has had environmental benefitsM KOPA estimates that its PAYG solar services have prevented 2m tonnes of CO2 from entering the atmosphereAccording to the companyM KOPA has generated86m in income for the countries in which it operates and created467m in cost savings for households M KOPA users make their financial transactions through the aforementioned M PESAwhich is also an example of African European cooperation( Pesais the Kiswahili word formoney ) M PESA is a mobile banking service formed by a joint venture between Vodafone and SafaricomThe company enables users to depositwithdrawand transfer moneyas well as to pay for goods and services using PIN secured text messageson their mobile devicesM PESA had 22 6 million active customers in 2019 and has expanded into central and southern AfricaEthiopiaand EgyptThis has provided access to financial services to people who previously lacked it Just as Solinc has allowed ordinary Kenyans to use off grid solar power solutionsbusinesses in Kenya are also taking advantage of the increased supply of solar power generation created by the country s green energy innovation ecosystemSome firms have built their own solar power plants using locally manufactured solar panelsFor examplethe Kenya Tea Development Agency (KDTA) announced in March 2021 that it would install solar power plants at 29 of its factories to reduce power costs(Kenya is the world s third largest tea producer ) KTDA is not alone in making this transition to solar energy Kenyan steel manufacturer Blue Nile Rolling Mills is installing a 1 5MW plant In west Africatwo other indigenous solar panel manufacturing companies have emerged that could take off as Kenya s Solinc didbenefiting from foreign partnerships and the integration of mobile banking and digital platforms Strategic Power Solutions (SPS)a subsidiary of the Ghanaian conglomerate Strategic Security Solutions Internationalbuilt a manufacturing plant in 2016 with an initial annual capacity to produce 30MW of solar modulesIn 2019 American engineering firm AEG International entered into a partnership with SPS to create solar energy systems to power schoolsclinicsand other facilitiescombining SPS solar modules with AEG equipmentAs a resultSPS is expanding its capacity by a total of 500 per cent across west AfricaAEG s successful partnership with SPS was facilitated by a grant from the US Trade and Development Agency West Africa s other solar panel manufacturerFaso Energybegan production in 2020Based in Burkina Faso and financed by private investorsFaso Energy s5m plant was built through a partnership between the country s government and Spain s Mondragon Corporationwhich supplied a semi automatic PV production line for the facilityWith an annual production capacity of upwards of 120MW of solar panelsFaso Energy provides a strategic partnership opportunity for European firms andpotentiallythe European Green Deal(As discussed belowthere are ways for the EU to better align its European Green Deal and other major programmes to support such investments in Africa )Not all European activity currently combines the full range of elements that make up local green energy innovation ecosystemsFor exampleFrench multinational utility company ENGIE has entered the field by buying three African PAYG solar companiesIn this wayit has become a player in off grid solutions for sub Saharan Africaproviding solar power to 4 million peopleIt has also followed M KOPA s sales modelHoweverENGIE does not appear to be supporting local solar panel manufacturingIn 2018 it acquired American firm Fenix Internationalwhich sells off grid energy products in BeninCôte d IvoireZambiaand MozambiqueIn 2019 ENGIE acquired German firm Mobisolwhich is a competitor to M KOPA in Kenya and also operates in Rwanda and TanzaniaAfrican mini grid construction start up PowerCornerincubated at ENGIE starting in 2015operates mini grids in Zambia and Tanzaniaand is constructing new mini grids in UgandaBeninand Nigeria Other companies are also entering the African market without partnering with African firmsAmerican start up ZOLA Electric (formerly Off Grid Electric) provides PAYG solar services in west African countries NigeriaGhanaand Côte d Ivoirewhile also operating in Tanzania and Rwandain east AfricaZOLA Electric conducts operations in Côte d Ivoire as a joint venture with French electric utility giant EDF and has received investment capital from French energy major TOTALEnergies and pioneering American electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Wider ramificationsIf African and European partners can together harness the synergy between solar energy and consumer mobile banking enabled by enhanced network coveragethey can also empower enterprises that promote wider social and economic developmentThis is evident with Swedish water purification start up Wayout Internationalwhich is supported by Ericsson and Norwegian telecoms firm TelenorWayout International makes micro purification modules that can produce drinking water for up to 300 households each dayreducing both CO2 emissions and the need for plastic bottlesThe system is affordable for communities because customers use the service on a PAYG subscription through a mobile appTelenor has no direct operations in Africabut its internet of things subsidiary Telenor Connexion is providing network solutionsincluding SIM cards and full cellular internet of things connectivity management servicesEricsson s internet of things accelerator is providing funding forand expertise on how to securely operatethe system on standardised worldwide mobile network infrastructureThe system s pilot project has been successfully operating in Ugandaproducing 70 000 litres of pure drinking water every month and selling at competitive prices to 22 000 customersThe system is now set to expand to nine other sub Saharan African countries These examples demonstrate the impact of European involvement in PAYG services powered by solar energyThis can stimulate the local manufacture of solar cellspanelsand modules in sub Saharan Africaand can address pressing social and health needsIf the EU and its member states want to exercise a leadership role in the development of African solar power manufacturing value chains (and other industries)they need to incentivise European companies to invest in the scalability of sub Saharan African solar panel manufacturing and purchase locally produced solar panels Data centresAround half of mobile money accounts worldwide belong to consumers based in sub Saharan AfricaAnd the region is on track to see the fastest growth in mobile money anywhere in the world through to 2025An estimated 700 new data centres are needed to meet the continent s growing demand for data storage and thereby support other digital activityThis will likely require 1 000MW of additional installed power generation capacityRecently opened private data centres in Nigeria and Kenya consume 10MW and 18 9MW respectivelyHeavy data centre investments will be required in South AfricaKenyaNigeriaand Ghana andto some extentin other countries with expanding ecosystemssuch as Côte d Ivoire and UgandaThe new trend of establishing co location campuses very large data centres will also increase demand for powerwith one Kenya based co location campus project slated to consume 42 5MWThis considerable rise in energy demand lends added urgency to the adoption of solar powerproviding further opportunities for European firms to partner with African enterprises The region s digital advance also creates severe vulnerabilitiesas sub Saharan Africa lacks comprehensive internet data and privacy regulationEarlier this yearthe OECD found that only 28 African countries had enacted comprehensive personal data protection legislationand just 11 had adopted significant laws on cyber crimeThe operation and ownership of data storage centres in sub Saharan Africa is crucial to the region s digital sovereignty and security By investing in data storage in African countriesEuropean firms can help improve these statesdigital security and sovereignty giving them a competitive advantage over Chinese firmsOne of the greatest concerns for African governments and businesses should be their vulnerability to the abuse of their digital platforms and data by the Chinese governmentEuropeans can help in this area by operating in compliance with the framework of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy and its directive on the security of network and information systemsEurope could then use its involvement in African data storage to gain entry into expanding African markets linked to the internet of things The case of Senegal s70m national data centre provides a cautionary tale in this regardIn June 2021Senegal s presidentMacky Sallinaugurated the data centredeclaring thatw e have to rapidly repatriate all national data hosted out of the countrySall ordered his governmentto migrate all state data and platforms to the data centreHoweverthisnationaldata centre was built by Huawei and financed by a Chinese loan calling into question the efficacy of Senegal s exercise of secure and sovereign control over its dataOnce the data centre becomes operational in early 2022Chinese technology will dominate practically of all of Senegal s cyber infrastructure Electric vehiclesAs the lion economies of Africa began to roar in the mid 2010sglobal automakers began turning their attention towards sub Saharan AfricaThis led Bloomberg News in 2015 to describe sub Saharan Africa as thelast frontier for car makers on the hunt for growthSince thenthere has emerged an even firmer global industry consensus on the prospects of the region s car market The question on Africa isn t is it a market of the futureNissan s managing director for Africa operations explained in a 2019 interviewit s a case of when As car use increases on the continentAfrican governments and multinational carmakers are eyeing the possibility of leapfrogging internal combustion engine vehicles and advancing directly to electric vehicle productionFor African governmentselectric vehicle adoption is already an urgent economic and environmental imperativeIn most African countriesthe import of new and used cars is the second highest contributor to their current account deficitssurpassed only by the cost of petroleum and petroleum productsIncreased local or regional production of affordable vehicles in Africa would be an important economic boon for the continentMoreoverurban regions of Africa are facing an environmental and health catastrophe due to the prevalence of highly pollutingend of life internal combustion engine vehiclesThese substandard used cars 80 per cent of which are unable even to pass the less stringent 2005 Euro 4 emissions standard spew a tremendous amount of toxic carbon emissions into the air of Africa s major citiesa problem worsened by their extremely low fuel efficiency Volkswagen s Africa division estimates the potential new car market in sub Saharan Africa to be 3 4m vehicle sales a yearThe new car market in the region could reach or exceed sales of 15m vehicles a year by 2035especially if companies make affordable models locallySenior executives in the Africa divisions of Volkswagen and Hyundai have expressed their enthusiasm about the emerging electric vehicle markets in the regionIf there is rapid growth in the number of electric vehicles in sub Saharan Africathere will be a proportional rise in demand for solar energy and ICT and internet of things solutions A former chair of Volkswagen s Africa divisionThomas Schäferconfirmed that the company wants to develop a pan African end marketHe explained the company s larger vision for this the big game will be to connect KenyaRwandaNigeriaSouth Africa and create an African marketBecause then youaretalking a billion peopleand then you can walk away from exporting to Americaexporting to Germany What s the pointYou ve got the market right hereIn terms of introducing electric vehicles into that end marketthe company considers its e Golf pilota blueprint for electric mobility in AfricaThis level of ambition from major carmakers indicates the potentially great implications for green energy innovation ecosystems more widely in Africa HoweverEuropeans are currently failing to work with local firms in the same way as their rivals from China and South Korea are (to name just two countries)The EU and EU based companies have not engaged with local African manufacturers in joint venturesThereforeEuropeans risk missing out on a vital form of engagement For examplewith the help of the China Hi Tech Group Corporationa leading special purpose vehicle makerUganda s government created the state owned Kiira Motors Corporation (KMC) to produce buses for mass transitKMC will soon go into full production of a fully electric90 passenger mass transit bus intended to reduce pollution across the countryElsewhereSouth Korean automaker Hyundai has assumed pole position in the race for electric vehicle production in sub Saharan Africa by creating electric vehicle assembly lines in the region s two most populous countriesNigeria and EthiopiaIn 2019 Hyundai opened an assembly plant with the capacity to produce 10 000 cars annually in the Ethiopian capitalAddis AbabaThe company aims to export vehicles to the markets of KenyaSomaliaDjiboutiEritreaand SudanWorking through a joint venture partnership with Ethiopia s Marathon Motor EngineeringHyundai assembled its first IONIQ Electric model in Ethiopia in July 2020and is now positioned to market this all electric vehicle in the greater east African region Europeans should look more carefully at how to partner with local firms in the development of this industry andcruciallyat how its growth will affect related sectors KenyaAfrica s PAYG pioneerKenyahas significant potential to leapfrog to electric vehiclesIn the first half of 2021new car sales in Kenya increased by 35 per centKenya s transport sector accounts for 39 per cent of the country s CO2 emissionsAnd the Kenyan government is moving to facilitate the adoption of low carbon mobilityThe national electric utility company announced in March 2021 that it would invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure to create urban and roadside retail charging services Kenya s innovation ecosystem has provided its most effective electric vehicle adoption initiativessuch as Nopea Ridean all electric ride hailing start upThis is a Kenyan Finnish joint venture that launched as a pilot in 2018 in Nairobi with three Nissan Leafsand that by January 2021 had a fleet of 30 vehiclesIts Finnish parent companyEkoRent Oyprovided Nopea Ride with the ride hailing app to operate on Kenya s mobile networksThe service is currently in the process of expanding to 100 electric vehicles by January 2022With a357 000 grant from the Energy and Environment Partnership Trust Fund (EEP Africa)Nopea Ride is creating a solar charging hub in NairobiEEP Africa provided the grant to enable the Kenyan Finnish joint ventureto determine the precise technology and strategy for a larger scale rollout across East AfricaFrom a European perspectiveit is important to note that EEP Africa is funded by the Austria Development Agency and the Nordic Development Fund an institution supported by DenmarkFinlandIcelandNorwayand Sweden Nopea Ride is an example of the enormous opportunities Europeans have to initiate and scale up electric vehicle adoption in Africa through coordinated partnerships between European automakersenergy companiesand ICT firmsDue to the synergies between PAYG off grid solar pioneers Solinc and M KOPA and electric vehicle taxi services such as Nopea RideKenya s innovation ecosystem already has the basic infrastructure it needs to make an integrated transition to solar power and carbon free mobility built on value added manufacturing productionKenya s four primary automotive assembly facilities have a combined capacity to produce around 46 000 vehicles annuallyand have already assembled a variety of models including those designed by VolkswagenPeugeotVolvoand ScaniaCollectivelythe four assembly plants have received145m in investmentAny one of them could assemble electric vehicles with a relatively modest investment from an appropriate foreign partner RwandaVolkswagen has selected Rwanda for its electric mobility projectas a part of which it will launch its e Golf model as the first Volkswagen electric car in AfricaRwanda has one of the most active innovation ecosystems in sub Saharan AfricaVolkswagen s20m assembly plant in Kigali which can produce 5 000 units annually is focused on producing the company s B Segment Polo modelbut can also produce the Passat and othersThe components the plant uses are shipped from Volkswagen facilities in South Africa via Kenya in response to demandenabling the company to transfer small consignments to accommodate slight increases in demandand thereby incrementally expanding its market share Volkswagen can operate with the same nimbleness in the production of electric vehiclesThe firm is conducting its African electric vehicle rollout in partnership with German conglomerate Siemenswhich is providing the electric vehicle charging infrastructureAnd it is precisely the mobile enabled car sharing and ride hailing sector that Volkswagen envisages as developing the local market for these vehiclesTo this endthe firm is working with Rwandan start up companyAwesomity Labwhich developed the IT mobility softwareMove Appto offer these servicesThis integratedcross industry approach is introducing electric vehicles into a sub Saharan African market and capitalising on the opportunities of the digital realm while being supported by a serious growth in solar powerAs Volkswagen s Schäfer said the success of our innovative and pioneering mobility solutions business has shown us that Rwanda has the potential to leapfrog the internal combustion engines into electric cars Volkswagen s partnership with Siemens should encourage European automakers to engage with European firms outside the automotive sectorIndeedSiemens views the project as a step towards expanding its involvement in the emerging innovation ecosystems of east Africa s other lion economiesFurthermoreand as with other examples noted abovecooperation between VolkswagenSiemensand the Rwandan authorities in the electric mobility project also benefited from the important role played by a European development agency in this caseGerman agency GIZIt facilitated public private partnerships and advised on the development benefits of the project GhanaElectric vehicle production is moving ahead in Kenya and Rwandabut Europeans should acknowledge the potential of Ghana s green energy innovation ecosystem in this areaThey should consider how they can partner with Ghanaian firms to become more closely involved in the country s emerging industryGhana could soon prove to be importantto the adoption of electric vehiclesThe country has a domestic solar panel manufacturing sector that could support charging infrastructureMoreoverthe country has 1 575MW in surplus power production capacitywhich could enable it to serve as a launchpad for electric vehicle manufacturing In 2020 Ghana s car industry was valued at4 billion and projected to reach11 billion by 2026In March 2020Volkswagen opened a 5 000 unit assembly plant in the countryfulfilling a memorandum of understanding the company signed with Ghana during Chancellor Angela Merkel s tour of west Africa in 2018 which also saw it sign a similar memorandum of understanding with NigeriaIn contrast to Nigeriawhere progress has falteredthe Ghanaian government acted quickly to adopt its Ghana Automotive Development Policy (GADP)which imposed restrictions on used cars and offered tax incentives to global carmakersThis initiative is linked to other parts of the green energy innovation ecosystemVolkswagen is contemplating introducing integrated mobility services similar to Rwanda s Move Appraising the possibility of Volkswagen attempting an electric vehicle rollout in Ghana But Volkswagen is not alone in eyeing Ghana as its west African manufacturing hubAlso prompted by the GADPSuzuki and Toyota opened a joint vehicle assembly facility in the countryBy establishing its Ghana plantToyota matched Volkswagen in the east and west African automotive marketseach company now has assembly facilities in GhanaNigeriaRwandaand KenyaNissan has also set its sights on the west African marketconstructing an assembly plant in Ghana that is due to open in 2022and that with a capacity to produce 50 000 60 000 vehicles annually will overshadow both Volkswagen and ToyotaAndin April 2021Ghana s minister for trade and industryAlan John Kyerematenannounced that Hyundai would establish an assembly facility in GhanaAny one of these global automakers could begin assembling zero tailpipe emissions vehicles in the countrywhich would make Ghana west Africa s main hub for electric vehicle assembly Europe s roleGreen energy innovation ecosystems and Europe s global priorities in AfricaThe emergence of markets and industries with digital financial platforms has created successful new development models across sub Saharan AfricaThe expansion of such platforms and mobile networks has increased the generation ofand access tosolar power which also supports sub Saharan Africa s energy transition and efforts to counter climate changeThe evidence suggests that European investment in joint venturevalue added production in the region will succeed if it takes place in cooperation with local innovation ecosystemsTo make this a realitythe EU and EU members of the G7 will need to align their strategies with this priority In recognition of the geopolitical importance of the transition to a decarbonised economy beyond Europe s bordersthe EU is making climate a fully fledged part of its foreign policyCurrentlythere are multiple initiatives that can usefully contribute to thisranging from the European Green Deal to the Global Gateway and Build Back Better World (B3W) At the heart of this more outward facing stance is the European Green Dealwhich aims to mobilise a total of1 trillion to decarbonise the European economy and facilitate similar transitions abroadIt combines public financing with policies the EU hopes will unlock private sector investmentwithout which it will be impossible to mobilise1 trillion In additionEuropean policymakers have also devised their alternative to the BRIthrough which China is investing1 trillion in major projects in more than 100 countriesThe BRI is reshaping the architecture of global trade and commerceAs well as building new infrastructure through the BRIBeijing is using it to strengthen political ties with governmentsIn responsein December 2021the European Commission launched a global connectivity strategy called the Global Gateway FinallyEuropeans participate in the B3W initiativewhich was launched by the G7 in June 2021 with the same aims as the Global GatewayThe EU members of the G7 are GermanyFranceand Italyandas a transatlantic initiativethe B3W also includes the US (which leads it) and the UK The EU s climate and connectivity agendas are at different stages of developmentIts climate policy is more advanced than its approach to global connectivityMore broadlythe EU plays a relatively dominant role in European climate actionwhile European responses to the BRI are developing via two parallel initiativesone led by the EUthe other driven by the G7Howeveroverallthe EU is now assembling the strategies and policies it needs to support the green transition in sub Saharan Africa and it is giving them some financial heft Reframing European climate policy to support Africa s economic developmentTo succeed in this challengeEuropeans need to establish a clear priority for their climate policyTheir first step should be to consider the current image of European climate action in Africa andconsequentlyto work to reframe what they are offering In its inceptionthe European Green Deal was inwardly focused rather than led by foreign policyA source of intense debate among the 27 EU member statesthe deal represents a hard won compromise between national domestic considerations across the blocBy necessityit initially focused on agreeing to a path towards climate neutrality within the EUwith the foreign policy element emerging later and as a lower priority Early assessments of the geopolitical impact of an EU only climate strategy recognised that it would fail if the rest of the world did not pursue the same standardsFor this reasonunder the rubric of the European Green Deal policymakers began developing measures to preventcarbon leakagethe outsourcingfor economic gainof polluting production beyond the EU s borders (and legislative reach)To respond to that challengethe carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) leveraged the EU s greatest geopolitical asset the size of its single market to encourage exporters to Europe to reduce their carbon footprintThe CBAM essentially acts as a tax on any exports to the EU that are more carbon intensive than those that new European Green Deal driven regulations allow within the union Arguably the best known foreign policy measure on the EU s climate agendathe CBAM has risen to prominence in Africa Europe relationsand threatened to act as an unfair tax on Africa s economic development trajectory Of coursethe European Green Deal aims to achieve much more than the CBAMbutwhere a clear vision for the future should bethere is a vacuum into which the CBAM rushedTo address the problemEuropean policymakers should explicitly recognise the potential of Africa s green energy innovation ecosystems and thread it through their decision makingThis would replace the vacuum with a positive agendaThe EU currently mixes potentially punitive measures such as the CBAM with funding for adaptation to climate change and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissionsTogetherthese approaches lack strategiccohesion To create the strategic underpinning for a positive agendathe EU should start by acknowledging that the greatest contribution it can make to sub Saharan Africa and thatin turnthe region can make to global climate objectives is to ensure that the next stage of Africa s economic development is greenThis would account for the fact that Africa s historical contribution to global cumulative carbon emissions is a mere 3 per centand that precipitous changes to European climate policy risk harming its economic growth which is already struggling under the shocks of the health crisissupply chain disruptionsand inflationary pressure caused by the pandemicEuropean policymakers should show that they understand that sub Saharan Africa faces enormous hurdles to achieving growth while decarbonisingAccordinglythey should position Europe s climate foreign policy as the pre eminent tool for achieving these objectivesThis would simultaneously address the perception that European climate policies would harm Africa s economic development and that European policymakers are blind to Africa s needs The Global Gateway and Build Back Better WorldCoordination asidethe EU will need to work out how best to ensure these investments support the strategic objective described aboveTo succeed in thisand to reframe its climate policythe EU should embrace joint venture cooperation with innovation ecosystems and value added production in Africa A key reason for this is not simply greater efficiency and effectiveness on the European side (although that may be part of it) but also the nature and importance of Africa s green energy innovation ecosystems themselvesThese ecosystems are already driving growth in the new components of global connectivitymoving beyond a narrow BRI style focus on ports and roadsHaving understood thisEuropean policymakers should set out a holistic vision of connectivity that includes telecommunications networksmobile financeand infrastructure that generatesstoresand transports green energy precisely the components of Africa s green energy innovation ecosystemsThe Global Gateway could help build infrastructure for green energy productionadvanced information and communications networkselectric vehicle productionand other sectors in these ecosystems This process of reframing the foreign policy aspects of the European Green Deal in Africa would dovetail with the Global Gateway and the B3WUltimatelyall three initiatives would direct investment towards similar sectorsThe risk is that multiple initiatives lead to a dissipation of efforts and give rise to bureaucratic turf wars between EU institutionsButto really support this shift and make the most of the EU s combined financial and organisational powerthe bloc should cease to distinguish between its objectives on climate and its response to the BRIThe EU should combine the European Green Deal and the Global Gateway into a single overarching policyIf it does not do thisit will find itself investing across two (or threeincluding the B3W) programmes that all ultimately aim to support similar sectorsThe time to bring them together is nowas both the Global Gateway and the B3W are currently little more than formal aspirations lacking in concrete policy On the B3Wthe EU could work with GermanyFranceand Italy to promote a greater understanding of the importance of supporting Africa s green energy innovation ecosystemsAs well as aligning resources with strategythis would send the strongest possible message to the EU s African partners about the congruity and seriousness of European policy and actionand would provide the best possible basis for genuine future partnershipA crucial advantage of merging the Global Gateway with the European Green Deal is thatin terms of promoting business connectivitycommercial corridors only emerge when they are anchored in a manufacturing value chain that includes local value added productionThis is another weakness of the BRIas noted abovefor individual African stateseconomiesthe boon from BRI investments has been limited Thereforethe EU has an opportunity to offer more enduring and more attractive partnershipsThere are already successful European examples of this combination on a smaller scale for exampleFrench support for the automotive sector in MoroccoAt heartdecarbonising the economy Africa sEurope sthe world s is simultaneously an infrastructure and a manufacturing challengeThis paper has shown that local value added production anchored in improved infrastructure is already key to sub Saharan Africa s burgeoning green energy innovation ecosystemsIn this respectEuropeans have an opportunity to gain a first mover advantage if they act now Moreoversuch investment can also help level the playing field for European companies in Africa that have to compete with rivals backed by the Chinese stateBut Europe also needs to accelerate the transition away from the one sided dynamic of the old donor recipient relationshipwhich has hampered engagement efforts in the pastThese initiatives can also help reset Africa Europe relationsby supporting joint venture investments that create value added production in partnership with the firms at the centre of Africa s green energy innovation ecosystemsThey can do so in a way that assists the economies of both Africa and Europein the face of intensifying international competition RecommendationsThere is no shortage of ways in which the EU can better engage with this key agendaFor examplealthough the European Green Deal s inward focus predominatesitsEU as a Global Leaderchapter contains many of the provisions needed for investment driven engagement with green energy innovation ecosystemsSimilarlythe EU sTowards a Comprehensive Strategy with Africamay predate the European Green Dealbut it provides a sufficiently broad framework for the more specific programmes and financing to flourishThree of the strategy sfive partnershipsare relevantthe green transition and energy accessdigital transformationand sustainable growth and jobsIn additionthe Global Gateway promises to focus on infrastructure investments and make use of the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus the financial arm of the EU s External Investment Planwhich was approved in March 2021 to mobilise financing in Africa to the tune of29 18 billion As it is difficult to secure extra EU public funds for such purposesEuropean policymakers should promote public private partnerships in Africa as an important source of fundingPublic private partnerships have at times been dismissed in European civil society circles as government subsidies to the private sector that contravene free market principlesBut they are key to leveraging Europe s full potentialIndeedthe European private sector s investment inand partnership withAfrican businesses will be a force multiplier for EuropePublic funds provided by EU member states and the EU will not be of the scale needed to transform Africa s economiesEuropean private sector actors can fill this gapThe EU should play a coordinating role to enable them to work together European policymakers should consider the following points in these key areas of activity Foster Europe wide cooperation on investment in AfricaEffective public private partnership requires sufficient scaleEuropean actors in the private sector will need to cooperate with one another if they are to match but not imitate the scale of China s footprint in AfricaThis is complicated because industries in different member states compete with one anotheras do companies within and between member statesBut the ability to collaborate is what differentiates mega projects serviced by an array of Chinese private and state owned enterprises from individualcompeting European vendors providing piecemeal contributionsA past example is the Democratic Republic of Congo s INGA III mega dam projectChina made a whole of project offerwhile European players lacked a common financing mechanism and investment guarantor Promote solar powerThe investment programmes of the European Green Deal (or its successor after merging with the Global Gateway) should aim to incentivise coordinated cooperation between European energy and ICT companiespushing them to invest in local solar panel manufacturing in AfricaThis would promote the adoption of solar power in the form of industrial scale solar plantsand would help national power grids to decarbonise African and international ICT companies seeking to expand 4G and 5G coverage to support the growing use of smartphones and the internet of things also have an interest in African solar power generationas it can help meet the additional energy demand their networks requireUnder the auspices of the European Green Dealthe EU could incentivise European companies to purchase locally produced solar panels and invest in the scalability of sub Saharan African solar panel manufacturing Participate in telecommunications upgradesEurope s market position in Africa s next generation of green energy innovation ecosystems will depend on the level of European participation in sub Saharan Africa s transition to full 4G and 5G coverageOrange has a leading role to play in the development of these ecosystemsBut it will need

work with firms from China and other countries outside the EU Promote electric vehiclesThe European Green Deal s July 2021 Fit for 55 package aims to help the EU to achieve a 55 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030It calls for the EU to ensure thatby 2035all new cars sold in the bloc have zero tailpipe emissionsWith African innovation ecosystems helping spur the adoption of electric vehiclesand with local production of such vehicles starting to growthe European Green Deal can become the investment and programming engine to drive sub Saharan Africa s transition to low carbon mobilityVolkswagen s integratedcross industry approach in Rwanda demonstrates how firms can introduce electric vehicles into sub Saharan African marketsThe European Green Deal is especially well suited to promote European firms as leading partners in sub Saharan Africa s shift to the production of electric vehicles and widescale adoption of these vehiclesGIZ s successful intervention should serve as a model for EU level engagement with European firms across national boundaries Provide support on data centresThe European Commission should link itsEU Cybersecurity Strategyand its directive on the security of network and information systems to support the development of ICT in AfricaThe European Commission can provide advice and direct support to improve security and sovereign control over dataThese issues become particularly acute with sub Saharan Africa s pressing economic need to develop data storage centresCombined with new European investmentthe stronger protections that such rules provide African citizens should prove to be a more attractive offer than the Chinese alternative By developing a diversity of supply chains for key productsand by building stronger economic and political relationships with businesses and governments in sub Saharan AfricaEuropeans would achieve greater resilience in the emerging geopolitical competition with ChinaThis would also reduce the benefits China could gain in its pursuit of similar goals A reformed European Green Deal can accelerate green energy development in sub Saharan AfricaEU policymakers should consider merging the European Green Deal with the Global Gatewayand establishing new coordination mechanisms to drive investmentThis revised approach can support investment in the expansion and upgrade of cellular networkssolar panel manufacturinglocal electric vehicle productionand other new products and services driven by green energy innovation This paper has shown that some EU member statesinstitutional interventions have excelled at enabling effective African European partnershipsThey have fostered cross industry initiatives that use telecoms to develop new products and servicesThese initiatives should serve as models for EU level engagement with European firms across national boundariesAccompanied by a message that Europeans will lead the world in supporting sub Saharan African economies as they move towards a greener futurethe EU can help achieve the vital goals of decarbonising the global economy while holding its own geopolitically vis à vis major powers such as China About the

all their lives John Adams (1756)IN TODAY S DIGESTAround the nationkids are being sent back home for virtuallearning Nate JacksonWhen the coronavirus pandemic first escaped that Wuhan lab and hit American shoresmid March 2020 marked the beginning of 15 days to flatten the curveThat meant shutting down most of societyincluding schoolsto slow the spread of COVID 19 and allow hospitals the time to prepareIt soon became apparent that lockdowns did more harm than goodperhaps especially for schoolchildren left to stare at computer screens instead of being in the classroomAlmost two years latereven Democrats and the Leftmedia know better than to shut down schoolsTeachers unions are still stubbornly doing it anyway Chicago Public Schools are closed today after the teachers union voted last night (73approving) to return to remote learningSoafter two days back in the classroomparents of the 340 000 kids in the nation s third largest district are left scrambling to accommodate having their children back at home in front of a screenBut heyat least the union did it witha heavy heart and a singular focus on student and community safety Please The singular purpose of a union is to advance the interests of its membersThis is no different Patriot Post National Advisory Board member Barbara Jameswho is also a highly respected teachermade the case in our pages back in November 2020 that virtual learning is detrimental to children Our children will have lost months of educationgrowthnatural curiosity and discoveryand personal interactionsJames wrote The pandemic interruption will require student triage for years to come Even more so becausetwo years laterit keeps happening It s not just ChicagoMore than 450 000 students in cities from Newark to Atlanta to Milwaukee to Cleveland will be stuck at home againThe debate is roiling elsewherewith unions clamoring to close while even Democrat officials are fighting to keep kids in schoolThis is traumatizing our childrensaid newly inaugurated New York City Mayor Eric Adamswho aims to have open schools The way adults are responding to COVID is having a negative impact on our childrenThe safest place for children right now is in a school buildingStrand after strandwe can t continue to stop our children from developing socially and academically Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot sounded a similar themesaying I want to assure you that I am doing everything in my power to keep our students in schoolwhere they belonglearning JoeShut Down the VirusBiden likewise wants schools open We know that our kids can be safe when in schoolThat s why I believe schools should remain open Heckeven Anthony Fauci agrees It s safe enough to get those kids back to schoolbalanced against the deleterious effects of keeping them out The New York Times actually put it quite well For the past two yearsAmericans have accepted more harm to children in exchange for less harm to adults Don t get us wrongwe re old enough to remember when Democrats and the media lectured and mocked conservatives for saying schools ought to be openIt s still nice to see them come around On the bright sidewe suppose that virtual learning might prepare kids for remote jobs in the futureas the economy faces permanent changes brought by the pandemic Meanwhilethings are little better in the nation s colleges and universities Students are the lowest risk population on planet Earthsays Johns Hopkins expert Marty Makary Over the last six monthsthe risk of a person in the broader age group (15 24) dying of COVID or dying with COVID (the CDC does not clearly distinguish) was 0 001All or nearly all of those deaths were in a very specific subgroupunvaccinated people with a medical comorbidity Neverthelessacademiasupposedly run by really intelligent peoplecontinues doing very stupid thingsMakary points to GeorgetownPrincetonCornelland others as bad examples for maintaining rigorous mask and vaccine mandates on top of longone size fits all quarantinesIt s even more foolishhe saysin the midst of the highly contagious but incredibly mild Omicron strain sweeping the countryRather than embrace the natural immunity it conferswhich might just bring the pandemic s end closerschools at every level are leading the way in responding with panic and fear Worst of allthis response is what students from kindergarten through graduate school are learningThe consequences will last for decades They want you to believe that nothing is more important than the unarmed non insurrection of January 6 Douglas AndrewsCan ya blame them It doesn t take too keen a political mind to see that the Democrats are desperate dog food desperate to distract you from the raging dumpster fire that is the Joe Biden presidencyThat s why it s been J6 all day and every day The borderJ6 The economyJ6 Gas pricesJ6 COVIDJ6 MandatesJ6 InflationJ6 Heating costsJ6 CrimeJ6 School lockdownsJ6 The fentanyl epidemicJ6 AfghanistanJ6 RussiaJ6 ChinaJ6 The midterm electionsJ6Biden s catastrophic approval ratingJ6 J6J6 We know what you re thinkingToday is January 5so it ll all be over after tomorrowand then the politicians who control the presidency and both houses of Congress will get back to addressing the very serious issues affecting our nation rather than obsessing endlessly about this January 6 nothingburger We wish it were soBut you watchThe Democrats will be on an endless loop between now and November s midterm electionsThey ll keep shrieking and prattling on about how our democracy is in peril (even though it s a republic) and about how the Republicans want to keep black and brown people from voting (even though black and brown voters are running away from the Democrat Party)And all the while79 year old Scranton Joe Biden and his handlers will be doing for to these United States what Bill de Blasio just finished doing for to New York City To hear Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer tell itthe events of last January 6 were an insurrectionIt wasn tof coursebut they want you to believe as muchThat s why they wouldn t allow any real Republicans such as Jim Jordan or Jim Banks to sit on their special January 6 CommitteeAnd it s why they ve been withholding information from congressional RepublicansThey re afraid that the whole truth will get outrather than their preposterously one sided Trump o phobic narrative NoNancy and Chuck want you to believe that an angry bunch of middle aged white guys with MAGA hats and Trump flags nearly succeeded in overthrowing the most powerful nation in the history of the worldYesa relative handful of them stormed the CapitolWhat was their next moveTo take command of our militaryTo wrest control of the nuclear football from President Donald Trump Speaking of Donald Trumphe s outpolling Joe Biden these daysA recent Rasmussen poll had likely voters preferring Trump over Biden by 13As The Wall Street Journal s James Freeman writes No wonder Senate Democrats want to talk so much about the last days of the Trump presidencyThere s precious little for them to celebrate about the current oneNearly 54of Americans express disapproval of the job MrBiden is doing in the Oval Office a new high for his term in the RealClearPolitics average of public opinion pollsMeanwhile just 42 3of Americans approve of the president s work So folks aren t just reluctant to approve of the job Joe Biden is doingthey re actively displeased with his performanceAnd Nancy and Chuck and the rest of the Democrats know how to read an opinion poll Yikesthey re yellingLet s talk about J6 Was January 6 an insurrectionGet realNext time you hear an acquaintance call it an insurrectionask himHow many of the more than 700 people who were arrested have been indicted for insurrectionor seditionor treasonIf he seems stumpedmaybe give him a clueTell him it s the same number of folks Robert Mueller indicted for criminally conspiring with RussiaZero YeszeroAnd that s exactly what the Democrats have to offer the American people By the wayDid you know that more people refused to accept the results of the 2016 election than the 2020 electionIt s trueaccording to the Washington Examiner s Byron Yorkwho writes that while 58of Republicans today say Biden wasn t legitimately elected67of Democrats said the same thing about Trump back in 2017 As usualthe Democrats are accusing Republicans of precisely what they themselves are guilty of If the GOP takes back Congress in 2022this is a seriousand warrantedpossibility Emmy GriffinTexas has the grave responsibility along with New MexicoArizonaand California of guarding the southern borderThe Lone Star State in particular has borne the brunt of the Biden administration s open borders policyThe extent of the damage to our nation s sovereignty is not yet fully countedbut one thing is for sureThis was a dereliction of presidential duty according to Article II of the Constitution Texan politicians have been calling for the law to be upheld and for ICE agents to be allowed to do their jobsbut they have been met with deaf ears and an indifference from WashingtonIt is this same elitist indifference to the people whom they govern that has already begun to turn tides in political racesThe recent GOP victory in Virginia is a canary in the tunnel for the Democrats The midterms are expected to be a big loss for the Democratsand the GOP is ready to make some changes including one big oneOn his podcastRepublican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas mentioned thatshould the GOP take the House in 2022articles of impeachment might be introduced against President Joe Biden The problem with Republicans beginning proceedings toward impeachment is that the Democrats have cheapened impeachment by their actions against President Donald TrumpAs you may recallthe Democrats impeached President Trump twiceOn both occasionsthe allegations were based on hearsay and an outright hoaxTrump had not broken the law and Democrats had no casebut they impeached him anywayThe Democrats turned impeachment into a cynical political weapon in their arsenal Making a mockery of a serious proceeding is nothing new for the Democrat PartyTakefor instancethe last time Republicans impeached a Democrat presidentBill ClintonThere were four articles of impeachment brought against President ClintonThe House charged him with twolying under oath and obstructing justiceAnd yet all people can remember is Monica Lewinsky and the salacious affairAs tawdry as it may behaving an extramarital affair is not illegalIt was Bill Clinton s perjury and obstruction that was illegalBut this bait and switch is nothing new for the Left and its media propaganda machines In the case of a possible Biden impeachmentthere are actual grounds for this sort of check on the executive branch s leaderThe crisis at the border is now everyone s problem because Biden s administrative cronies systematically and with intent compromised the southern borderThey put into place memos and mandates restricting Border Patrol agents from being able to effectively do their jobThe border is a mess that cannot be hidden by the mainstream mediaso they ignore it This is the biggest difference between the Trump impeachments and a potential Biden impeachmentTrump had committed no crimeBiden is flagrantly breaking the law and scorning his constitutional duty as president To quote Senator Cruz I said at the timewhen we have a Democratic president and a Republican Houseyou can expect an impeachment proceedingThat is not how impeachment is meant to workHe is absolutely rightImpeachment is a sober means by which Congress can keep in check the executive branchand the Democrats have turned it into something petty and tawdryYetin spite of thisRepublicans should go forwardIn this caseit is justice Joe Biden has spent his first year in office using every federal agency for this agenda Michael SwartzClimate extremes dominated the news over the holiday seasonwith fatal tornadoes in Kentucky and surrounding stateswind whipped wildfires in Colorado that destroyed neighborhoodsand a deluge of snow in the Lake Tahoe region that stranded motorists and set a December record for snowfallalleviating the recent California drought in one fell swoopResidents of the Mid Atlantic region went from enjoying record setting 70 degree weather over this past weekend to enduring a foot of snow seemingly in the blink of an eye Despite the fact that all these events are unusual but not exactly unprecedentedthese media enhanced weather patterns set the impression of climate change as being out of controlNeedless to saythat narrative fits right in with the Biden administration s push to use Uncle Sam s power and might (not to mention billions of taxpayer dollars) in the misguided belief that it can curb global climate change through both foreign and domestic policy It took nanoseconds last January for the incoming Joe Biden to show he meant business on fundamentally transforming our climate approach by pulling the plug on the vital Keystone XL pipeline projectAfter catching his breatha week later Biden put out a lengthyExecutive Order on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and AbroadIn itthe administration decreed It is the policy of my Administration to organize and deploy the full capacity of its agencies to combat the climate crisis to implement a Government wide approach that reduces climate pollution in every sector of the economyincreases resilience to the impacts of climate changeprotects public healthconserves our landswatersand biodiversitydelivers environmental justiceand spurs well paying union jobs and economic growthespecially through innovationcommercializationand deployment of clean energy technologies and infrastructureSuccessfully meeting these challenges will require the Federal Government to pursue such a coordinated approach from planning to implementationcoupled with substantive engagement by stakeholdersincluding Statelocaland Tribal governments Interesting how the most important stakeholders the American people were kept out of that onebecause climate change is seldom one of their biggest concerns until government policy ostensibly to address it costs them more at the pump or in the heating billAnd was anyone asked just what the optimum climate is that we re trying to achieve As part of that January executive orderthe administration announced in October that over 20 of its agencies and departments had submittedClimate Adaptation and Resilience PlansWe re not sure why the Social Security Administration or Smithsonian Institution need to worry about climate adaptation and resiliencebut theyamong othershave a plan just in case Howeverthere was another section of Biden s January executive order that recently raised Republican ireThanks to the stroke of his pena new agency was created within the Department of Health and Human ServicesThe Office of Climate Change and Health Equity was tasked with a missionto protect vulnerable communities who disproportionately bear the brunt of pollution and climate driven disasterssuch as drought and wildfiresat the expense of public healthAccording to National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy The new HHS Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE) is fulfilling President Biden s vision to bring America s world class medical community into the fight against climate change a fight for our health that ensures no community is left behind While that sounds awfully high mindedRepublicans question whether OCCHE is duplicative and redundantgiven that it was created by executive order and not by legislation Thatthoughseems to be small potatoes given the rush of the Biden regime to put more taxes on oil or decree that our nation will be carbon neutral by 2050Even nowthe government is taking the first steps through a massive overhaul of its vehicle fleet tozero emissionvehiclesthen retrofitting buildings with a similar goal in mindAnd if that s not enoughthe Biden scheme demands100 percent carbon pollution free electricity by 2030at least half of which will be locally supplied clean energy to meet 24 7 demandWho will pay for thatAnd unless they cover the landscape with Chinese made solar panels or imported wind turbineswhere will they get that energy Obviouslyany executive order can be rescinded by the next occupant of the Oval Officebut the process of turning the ship around will be nearly impossible given the widespread efforts from the Biden administration and that s what they re counting onEven if the Republicansquestioning of the executive order bears the fruit of stopping the OCCHE office in its tracksthe forces of goodlimited government are barely playing whack a mole with everything that pops up from the fertile minds of those who tell a good story about how we re irrevocably harming our planet It s a story that won t have a happy ending until that pen is taken away from Joe Biden and his allies It can t be stolen in an afternoon by an angry mobwe lose it by letting it slip through our fingerspiece by piece Jack DeVineAbraham Lincoln said it bestOurs is a government of the peopleby the peopleand for the peopleThat simple principle republican government is the prime source of America s greatnessWe ve managed to hang onto it for 240 yearsbut many today are voicing concerns that our Republic is slipping away Count me as one who is concerned about this erosionalthough for reasons quite different than the ones we often hear The episode that seems to arouse the most concern is the riotous assault on the U SCapitol one year ago tomorrow the one President Joe Biden calls theworst attack on our democracy since the Civil War That s nonsenseno matter how aggressively pushed by politicians and mediaJanuary 6 was an uglyviolentand indefensible mob action a national embarrassmentBut there was never a real possibility that a ragtag swarm of unarmed and disorganized hooligans would somehow overthrow the United States of AmericaThe 2020 election certification they tried to disrupt recommenced that very night Democracydidn t miss a beat Our Republic can t be stolen in an afternoon by an angry mobIf we lose itit will be because we let it slip through our fingerspiece by pieceover time Take a closer lookOur form of government is properly called a democratic republicin which we citizens elect leaders to act in our behalfFor that to workwe need (1) an electorate that makes informed choices(2) a voting process that is transparent and secureand (3) elected leaders who act in their constituentsbest interestsWe re losing ground in all three Informed electorateIn 2017just after President Donald Trump took officethe venerable Washington Post adopted the sloganDemocracy Dies in DarknessThat s an ironic choiceWhile it s hard to disagree with the inherent truth of those wordsthe Post and most other print and broadcast media tend to illuminate only one side of controversial issueshardly shedding enough light to support well informed choices Even more worrisome is the stranglehold Big Tech (Facebook MetaTwitteret al ) exerts on information available to the publicTheir platforms reach billions worldwideand they decideunilaterallywhat their readers (surelya majority of American voters) get to see and what they do not There may be a constitutional issue hereWhile the First Amendment does not apply to private companiesBig Tech is arguably a government communicator (for exampleon COVID matters)At some pointthe courts will weigh in But in the meantimedo we really want unelectedunaccountablepoliticizedand privately funded organizations to select the next presidentThat arguably already happened in 2020 Voting processMany states hurriedly adopted sweeping changes in voting policy and practice before the 2020 electionnominally to address restrictions imposed by the pandemicThe changes yielded unprecedented voter turnout a good thing but corresponding uncertainty about election security In principleit s simpleVoting is for citizensand all citizens deserve both a reasonable opportunity to vote and confidence that every legal and legitimate vote will countBut as weimprovethe process by expanding remote voting or relaxing voter ID requirementswe make voting easier but less secure another chink in the armor Hyper partisanshipIn both houses of Congressparty line block voting by elected representatives and senators has become the normThat practice effectively nullifies the votes of those whose elected legislators choose to obey the dictates of their party bosses rather than act in the best interests of their constituents And the Democrat led U SSenate continues to tinker with established Senate rules (reconciliation and filibusteras examples) in order to enhance the Democratsrazor thin ruling powerDoing so further muffles the voices of all who voted for the 50 Republican senators Each of the above examples is a very real impediment to practical exercise of what is colloquially called democracy in America For those understandably concerned about the January 6 debacleyou can be sure that we ll be hearing much more about it in the year aheadas the House of Representatives continues its massive investigation(That s the same legislative body that last year decided in just one day that it knew enough about what happened to impeach a president ) This weekDemocrats outlined plans to roll out their findings in the fall of 2022coincidentally just before the midterm electionsPoliticsagainrule the day All Americans leftrightand center have a stake in our RepublicSo let s skip the political grandstanding and zero in on its real vulnerabilities And don t letdemocracy die in the darknessof a January 6 smokescreen He s told a lot of thembut this particularly nasty one about apandemic of the unvaccinatedhas now been thoroughly debunked Douglas AndrewsIt s no secret that Joe Biden has an uneasy relationship with the truthnor that this is especially so concerning his claims about vaccination For exampleHe was long ago proven to be a liar when he was asked whether vaccination should be mandatory and he answered NoI don t think it should be mandatoryI wouldn t demand that it be mandatoryLikewisehe was long ago proven to be a liar when he told one of CNN s resident pervertsDon Lemonduring a town hall meeting in July You re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinationsSame with the lie he told just last month when he challenged our patriotism before sneering How about making sure that you re vaccinated so you do not spread the disease to anybody else Memo to Snake Oil JoeHow about making sure you ve got your facts before making such bold and sweeping pronouncements Thosethougharen t the vaccination lies we re looking forNothe ones we had in mind were those that smeared and vilified the unvaccinated It s a pandemic of the unvaccinatedBiden lecturedjust before clarifying things as only he can It s a vaxation of the unvaccinated Then he washedand he rinsedand he repeatedTime and againhe said things like This is a pandemic of the unvaccinatedThe unvaccinatedNot the vaccinatedthe unvaccinatedIn facthe said it again just yesterday Only problem wasit wasn t and it isn t We all make mistakesAnd we all trip over our wordsIt s just that this president does it all the timeand he sounds so sanctimonious when he does soThat s why thisvaxation of the unvaccinatedneeds to be vax checkedIt s a slogan thatas Reason s Matt Welch noted recently The White House COVID 19 Response Team introduced in mid Julyand which the president was still regurgitating inaccurately as late as December 14 Scratch thatHe was regurgitating it yesterday To be fairscarcely anyone believes anything this guy says anymoresuch are the disjointed and ill informed ramblings we get each time he strays for even a sentence from his tightly scripted remarksBut stillHe s the president of the United StatesIs it too much to ask that he at least be honest about matters that are so fundamental Could it be that Scranton Joe s been getting bad adviceYou tell us When you get vaccinatedsaid his main manAnthony Fauciin May you not only protect your own healththat of the familybut also you contribute to the community health by preventing the spread of the virus throughout the communityAnd in other wordsyou become a dead end to the virus When you get vaccinated you become a dead end to the virus Apparentlythey didn t get the memo in Germanywhereas Daniel Horowitz reports The respected Robert Koch Institute reported last week that among the 4 206 Germans infected with Omicron for whom their vaccination status was known95 58were fully vaccinated Nor did they get the memo in Denmarkwhere 89 7of all Omicron cases were among the fully vaccinatedor in the UKwhere only 25of hospitalizations are among the unvaccinated If you re sensing a pattern hereso are weAnd so is Horowitz A new preprint study from Bangladesh found that among 404 people re infected with COVIDhaving been vaccinated made someone 2 45 times more likely to get re infected with a mild infection16 1 times more likely to get a moderate infectionand 3 9 times more likely to be re infected severelyrelative to someone with prior infection who was not vaccinated So the science out of Bangladesh now joins the science out of Israel in resounding fashionNatural immunity isn t just a little better than vaccine immunityit s a lot better Of coursethis isn t to say that vaccines are badOnly vaccine mandates are badIndeedfor at risk groups such as the elderly and others with comorbidity factorsvaccines can be life saving and have proven to lessen the severity of subsequent variant infectionsBut for the rest of usfor whom the virus is far less likely to be lethaldoes the vaccination outweigh the considerable benefits that would otherwise be conferred by natural immunityIt s a great questionand one that no one in the Biden administration nor anywhere on the Left seems interested in exploring As candidate Joe Biden said on October 222020 Two hundred twenty thousand Americans deadIf you hear nothing else I say tonighthear thisAnyone who s responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America WellJoewe heard yaAnd according to Johns Hopkins Universityfrom the time you took office last January 20 until this past MondayJanuary 3we ve lost 419 200 Americans to COVID 19By our reckoningyou either owe Donald Trump an apology or the rest of us your resignationOr both Finallywe ve been focused on vaccinationbut what is it with this president s masking fetishThe images of Biden and the first lady walking their dog on a windswept beach in Delaware over the holidays images that show Biden masked upoutdoorswith nary another human in sight are truly jarringHas anyone ever contracted or

videos on YouTube unless it is to criticize them or announce that viewers can see my content on rumble comWhy begin with YouTubeBecause they re the worst censors Senator Rand Paul Elon Musk can afford to buy FacebookYouTube and TwitterImagine if he did it and systematically censored Democrats and leftists We re being silencedSilencedThe shrieks would be audible for milesHow speedily the other side

Obvious People who are overweight or obese are at a much higher risk of much more severe disease and even death from Covid 19 and one new study suggests that losing weight can reduce that risk CNN ( I m really glad that CNN is finally catching up to the rest of us who ve had functioning prefrontal cortexes the past two years Jesse James)D oh How can we Democrats permit a situation in which Republicans can pass voter suppression laws at the state level with only a simple majority vote but not allow the United States Senate to do the same Senate Majority Leader Chuck SchumerAnd last Women are born homemakers we literally provide a home to our children within our wombsAbortion uproots the safe home for children in our bodiesIt makes sensethenthat people who believe abortion is a moral
